## 6. Library Overview

### 6.3 Standard-Library Headers and Namespace

- `std` is the standard library namespace
- We need to include the parts that we want to use, e.g. `#include<list>`
- (*Note: `<algorithm>` and `<future>` look interesting*)
- For C standard library headers such as `<stdlib.h>`, there are aliases without the `.h`: `<cstdlib>`
