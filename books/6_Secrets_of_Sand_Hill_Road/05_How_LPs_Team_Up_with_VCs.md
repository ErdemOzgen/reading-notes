## 5. The “Limited” Edition: How LPs Team Up with VCs

* LPs are limited in the sense that
    * they have very limited say in what VCs invest into. VCs and LPs agree on a rough outline for a fund, and the VC then chooses companies that fit this broad description. LPs really are passive investors
    * they have limited liability, i.e. they will not get sued if the fund messes up
* 2017 tax reform
    * VC funds are partnerships between general partners (the ones leading a VC) and LPs. Since the tax reform, this means that the VC fund does not directly get taxed. Instead it passes on all earnings to the partners who are then taxed. This is great for tax-exempt entities, like university endowments
    * C companies (most big tech companies, e.g. Apple) do not have this advantage. Their earnings and distributions are both taxed
* LP agreement (LPA)
    * Legal document describing the partnership
    * Most funds charge 2% management fee. Really good ones might charge 3%. There's variations though, e.g. sometimes the fee is reduced once everything is invested (and VCs have less work) or the fee is only computed for the money already invested
    * VCs receive money as they invest, so the cash does not sit iddle in the VC's bank
    * Most VCs are not paid to sit on company's boards since they would need to deduct that salary from the management fee. This is only true until IPO though
* Carried interest (fee on return)
    * VC charge 20-30% of returns
    * (*Note: Everything so far seems identical to hedge funds*)
    * However, it can be difficult to estimate the return of the company is not public yet
    * There are many options: Quantifying based on last evaluation, comparing to similar companies and their P/E ratio, Black-Scholes model
    * VCs cannot take this fee out as they go
        * When the first company is sold, taking 20% out is problematic because it’s still possible that the rest of the fund fails, in which case there would be negative returns. Some LPs are fine with the VC taking the 20% out though, on the condition that they pay it back later if they took too much
        * Instead of taking out the money, it can be preferable to re-invest it into other companies in the same funds
    * *Hurdle rate*: Rate above which returns have to be (e.g. 8%) for the VC to be able to charge carried interest on all of it
    * *Preferred return*: The VC can only charge carried interest for any returns above the preferred return rate
* Most VCs provide 1-5% of the fund capital themselves (1% is most common). The rest is raised from LPs
* The GP's position towards aquisitions can heavily depend on how well the rest of the fund is doing. If they need a success, they will be much more likely to be in favor of an aquisition
* LPA investment description
    * LPA roughly describes what the fund should invest in
    * Investment domain: e.g. life science companies in an early stage
    * Best ideas: Rules for how much of their own money GPs can invest into the fund's companies
    * Time: Running the fund has to be the GP's main job
    * If a certain portion of the LPs (1/3 or 2/3) feel these agreements were violated, they can suspend the fund
* Most GPs vest their share of the fund over time
