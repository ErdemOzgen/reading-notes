## 14. Difficult Financings: When Bad Things Happen to Good People

* *Down round*: Raising money at a lower valuation than in the previous round
* Similar fiduciary duties as in previous chapter
* Down rounds are often lead by existing investors. When they are not, existing investors might give up on liquidation preferences or shares to incent new investors
* When VCs invest in down rounds and the company ends up being a huge success, common shareholders are often unhappy about dilution and might sue
* Courts follow the same process as in the previous chapters: Check how many board members are independent
* There are simple ways to prevent such a situation
    * Offer common shareholders to participate in the new funding round
    * Ask many other VCs for better offers
    * Make the term sheet go-shop, the opposite of no-shop
    * Be careful with giving out new option grants before voting on such a funding round
* It is common to downsize the company in down rounds
* *MIP*: *Management Incentive Plan*
    * 8-12% equity for key company employees
    * Often to ensure that an acquisition goes down successfully
    * If the acquisition is higher than expected and these employees also make money from their common shares, their MIP payoff is reduced dollar for dollar
    * Boards should design MIPs carefully to give the right incentives
* *WARN* Act
    * Companies with at least 100 (50 in CA) employees need to provide employees with a 60 day notice before shutting down
    * If the company fails to do so, it can be liable for 60 days of compensation
    * There are exceptions for when the company is trying to raise new capital during this time and has reasonable chances in succeding. Providing the 60 day notice would jeopardize the chances of getting the capital because of employees leaving
* Shutting down the company
    * If the company cannot pay employees anymore but still has them on payroll, directors are *personally* liable
    * Vacations days need to be paid out, otherwise the above applies
    * Contractors generally get paid out last
    * The only exception here is when companies act in bad faith, e.g. give contractors new contracts even though it is clear the company will not be able to pay
* Startups nowadays often take on debt in combination with raising money by selling equity
    * Different to convertible notes discussed earlier. These here are not convertible
    * Money is cheaper to raise by giving out bonds than by giving out equity
    * (*Note: I'm a bit surprised by these statements. This hasn't been mentioned earlier*)
    * Debt holders are the first to be paid out when a company shuts down. Equity holders come last. Trade creditors (contractors) are in between
    * The board owes no fiduciary duty to debt holders
