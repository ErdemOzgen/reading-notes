## 9. The Alphabet Soup of Term Sheets: Part One (Economics)

* *Term sheet*: Document detailing terms and conditions of an investment
* VCs have an advantage in negotiating term sheets since they do it all the time while founders might only do it a couple of times in their lives
* Security: Preferred Shares
    * C corps can have different classes of stock
    * The VC gets preferred stock, which have additional rights and advantages
    * Founders and employees get common stock
    * For each round of funding, there is an additional type of preferred stock, e.g. "Series A Preferred Stock"
* Aggregate Proceeds
    * Company and VC trade cash against equity
    * Before that happens, the company has to resolve any kind of debt it has, by converting it to equity
    * This is so that VCs can still be the first ones to liquidate their shares
    * When startups use bonds, they are typically convertible bonds, meaning they can automatically be converted to equity in certain events (e.g. when getting additional funding)
* Convertible debt details
    * Is generally converted at price that VC pays for equity
    * That's bad for the bond holder. They invested earlier and had more risk. This is why often the note includes a *capped price*, limiting the price of equity when converting the note into it
    * Alternatively, the note can contain a discount (e.g. 10%) that is applied when converting
    * Founders like this form of financing because it is very easy and does not require complex valuations, at least as long as the note is not capped
    * A big problem with this approach is that you are giving up equity without really being aware how much. You only find out once the notes are actually converted, and might then be surprised by how much equity you lost
    * VCs do not like this because shares get too diluted. To incentize the founder it might make sense to create additional equity for them. This, however, is problematic to do because it will dilute everyone else's equity even further
    * > Unlike whiskey, most problems do in fact not age well
* Price per share
    * VC gets the portion of equity they ask for after debt has been converted to equity and after the employee pool has been created
    * Company is valued according to one of the methods introduced in chapter 5
    * When going for Series B, C, ..., new investors often check whether the lead VC of Series A is still investing additional money. It's seen as a bad sign for the company if they do not
* Capitalization
    * Employee pool should be sufficient for hiring until next round
    * Founder wants to make the employee pool small because of dilution
    * VC wants the pool as big as possible because they get their portion after the pool has been allocated. For future rounds (where the pool will be increased) this will not be true, so for the VC it is better to make it bigger earlier
* Dividend
    * Startups can generally not afford to pay any dividends
    * There is a section in term sheets that says that a 6% dividend has to be paid to any preferred shares, before anything is paid to common shares
    * Idea: Founders can only take cash out of company if they pay the VC
* Liquidation preference
    * Rules for who gets liquidated first when the company is acquired
    * VC usually first gets their entire investment (1x) back, but other multiples could also be decided on (1.5x, 2x)
    * VCs that come in at later stages sometimes demand a higher factor because they pay more for the same equity. If the company then gets acquired soon after the financing, the new VC’s shares will not have appreciated much
    * (*Note: I don’t fully understand why that’s problematic. If they are bought out soon after the investment, doesn’t it make sense that they do not get a high return?*)
    * *Non-participating*: VC can either get paid out first *or* convert shares into common shares before being paid out
    * *Participating* means both is allowed, but that is fairly uncommon
    * *Pari-passu* (Latin) means that all preferred share holders get paid out at the same time. Alternatively, earlier investors could be paid out first
    * How VCs divide up the money makes no monetary difference for the founders, but it does change the incentives of the VCs (e.g. how they think about potential acquisitions)
    * Depending on the incentives, this might make the difference between VCs accepting an aquisition offer where you get no paid out at all, or declining it and waiting for better opportunities
    * (*Note: This is not mentioned in the book, but my feeling is that pari-passu means VCs are on average more likely to accept acquisition offers? It's difficult to tell though*)
* Redemption
    * Means paying back the VC to get the equity back
    * Very unusual for VC
    * If you had wanted redemption, you would get funding from a bank instead
* Conversion/Auto-Conversion
    * Before IPOs, it is common to convert all shares to common ones
    * Not all tech companies do/did this. Google and Facebook have dual-class stock (high-voting and low-voting class), Snap even has a tri-class structure
    * Sometimes, VCs only want to convert if the IPO is big enough and there is enough liquidity in the public market. This threshold can increase over funding rounds
    * Low liquidity means it is difficult to sell a lot of stock without moving the price. Currently, this is common for small-cap stocks
    * Most companies sell between 10-20% of the company at the IPO
    * VCs can give up on liquidation preferences if they think the company needs to be “restarted” and doing so will help raise new capital. It also helps to incentivize employees
    * It is smart to define in the term sheet that there should be a majority vote of all preferred stock for this. Otherwise, it can be extremely difficult to get everyone to agree to give up liquidity preferences
* Anti-dilution provisions
    * If a company’s valuation goes down in further funding rounds, dilution is especially strong for earlier investors
    * Even worse, what their share is worth will now be less than at the previous funding round
    * (*Note: It seems like this should be the case because of re-valuation, not because of new funding*)
    * “Schmuck insurance” can protect against this. It limits by how much the price can be adjusted when the company tries to get funding at a lower valuation
    * *Full ratchet* insurance would protect the full price that the VC paid originally
    * New equity is granted to pay out this insurance
    * Founders are subsidizing this, since they do not have any dilution protection
    * This section explains quite well why too high valuations can be dangerous
* Voting rights
    * Founders might want to get more voting rights, but this is fairly uncommon for pre-IPO, VC-funded companies
    * Some investors that come in late might be fine with just the financial opportunity, and agree to vote with the founder on all issues
    * *Springing dual-class structure*: As soon as the company IPO’s, all existing stock is converted to supervoting shares, which get many additional votes. Once they are sold, they become normal shares. This allows the founders to exercise a lot of control over the company once it is public, as most VCs will then slowly start to leave the company
