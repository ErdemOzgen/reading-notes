## Introduction

* VC invests anywhere from very early startups (handful of people) to high-growth companies focused on still scaling agressively
* Unlike other investment fund managers, VCs do not just put money into companies but assist them closely in many aspects
* Three ways to leave the venture ecosystem
    * IPO
    * Aquisition
    * Bankruptcy
* VC-funded companies have had a huge impact on the US economy
* (*Note: I'm a bit skeptical of the numbers presented in the book here, given that many companies take funding from different sources, so attributing all VC-backed companies to VC seems too simplified*)
* Nearly all net newly created jobs since 1997 are from new companies
* It takes companies, on average, 10 years now to IPO, which is longer than ever before
