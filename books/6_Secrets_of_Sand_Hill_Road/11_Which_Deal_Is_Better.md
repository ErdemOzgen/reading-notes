## 11. The Deal Dilemma: Which Deal Is Better?

* If you get offered two different deals, it can be hard to decide which one is a better fit since there are so many dimensions to consider
* More money is not always good. It can come with bad terms or you might just not need that much (and thus give up too much equity)
* Implications on dilusion are important to consider
* Payoff visualizations are useful: On X-axis is valuation, on Y-axis payoff for various share holders. Since a lot of clauses in the term sheet can affect the payoff, this is a useful visualization
* In respect to governance terms, most investors generally want terms (at least) as good as the ones previous investors got. This is why the first deal matters a lot
* What the best deal is highly depends on company and circumstances: how much money one needs, how confident one is in the company's future (and oneself as CEO), how much one is willing to gamble
* (*Note: This chapter would be good to re-read when actually comparing deals*)
