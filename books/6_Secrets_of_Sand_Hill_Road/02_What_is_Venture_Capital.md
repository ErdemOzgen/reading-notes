## 2. So Really, What Is Venture Capital?

* VC is not just for tech, e.g. Starbucks was VC funded
* Instead: VC is funding for businesses that do not fit traditional funding (from banks)
* Banks work well for businesses that can pay back the initial loan + interest after a few years. There's a definite expectation to become profitable within a few years
* VCs never expect the loan to be paid back. Instead, they are paid in equity, which gives the business a lot more liberty about when to become profitable
* Similarly, VCs are much more willing to fund high-risk ventures
* Angel investors (early investors) in the VC world sometimes invest using notes: This means the company has the option to pay back loan+interest after a few years, but can also pay with equity instead
* VC involves three groups
    * Investors (institutional, limited partners): Give money to VCs
    * VC: Chooses startups that receive said money in exchange for giving up equity
    * Entrepreneurs: Use that money to grow the company
* Institutional investors allocate a certain portion of their fund to VCs. This is not necessarily a great investment: The median VC return has been 1.6% below the NASDAQ on average in the past 10 years
* However, individual VC firms have vastly outperformed this median. These firms continue to outperform because of a self-reinforcing effect: Great startups try to be funded by the well-known VCs for exposure and advice. Research has also shown that the top VCs continue to outperform in the next cycles, because the same companies that made them top VCs continue to grow strongly
* Investment returns of individual VCs follow a power law distribution: There are very few real winners but they account for nearly all profit. Similarly, most investments are failures
* Signaling is important: Being funded by well-known VC firms brings many more advantages than just the capital
* (*Note: Probably true, but the author also has a strong incentive to promote that viewpoint*)
* VC mistakes 
    * False negatives are acceptable
    * False positives are incredibly bad because missing out on the few success stories of the power law distribution can ruin a VC's career
* Diversification is thus actually not a great strategy for VCs
* You need a certain net worth to legally be allowed to invest into VC funds ("accredited investor"/1M or "qualified investor"/5M)
* It's fairly hard for new VCs to start because they need success stories to get external capital invested (chicken and egg problem)
* (*Note: There's the same problem for new hedge funds but it seems to be less of an issue. I wonder why*)
* Investment stats of good VCs:
    * 50% of investments are (complete) loses
    * 20-30% return the investment or return double of it
    * The rest yield 10-100x the investment, and thus make everything profitable
* Thus the relevant metric for VCs is really how often they fund these huge successes. How often they make back their investment is not the primary metric. In fact, this can often be similar for really well and really badly performing VCs
* VC is actually still a small industry. Buyout funds have about 14x more capital in 2017
* Historically, VC really only became a thing in 1974, when US legislation paved the way to legally allow institutional investors to put their money into VC funds
