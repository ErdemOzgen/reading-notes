## 1. Born in the Bubble

* In 1999, limited partners (defined later) put $100 billion into VC funds
* This has never been topped again. In 2017, $33 billion were invested
* During the peak of the dotcom bubble, companies had a P/E ratio of 175
* It was incredibly easy to raise money back then, at least anecdotally
* After the bubble burst: <20 tech IPOs happened in 2001, compared to ~500 in 2000
* If you cannot get VC but need capital, the alternatives are a buyout or going public
* Since then, the amount of capital required to found have decreased. One can now rent servers instead of having to buy them for example
* Capital is not the main differentiator between VC firms. It's how much they can help to make the startup successful
* a16z: Fund engineering/product types of people and help them succeed
