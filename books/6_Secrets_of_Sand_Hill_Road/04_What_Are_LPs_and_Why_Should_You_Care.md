## 4. What Are LPs and Why Should You Care?

* LPs (limited partners) invest into VC funds in order to diversify their funds and in order to attempt to achieve alpha
* LPs aim to outperform common market indices by 5-8%
* (*Note: I'm fairly skeptical of that statement here. He's citing one specific LP, the Yale endowment, as evidence, even though many other endowments did much worse. Later on, the numbers for the Yale fund are also significantly below the here stated 5-8%*)
* Types of LPs
    * University endowments
    * Foundations
    * Corporate and state pension funds
    * Family offices
    * Wealth funds of countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia)
    * Insurance companies
    * Funds of funds
* VC is a kind of private equity fund
* Illiquid markets tend to have less efficient pricing
* University endowments
    * These can actually make up a huge portion of a university's budget. In the case of Yale, a third of the yearly budget comes from endowment returns, but only 10% from tuition
    * The Yale fund holds 4% public US stock, 16% public international stock, 16% VC
    * The VC part of Yale's fund has returned 77% annually over the last 20 years. Over the last 10 years it has been 18% (post dot-com)
    * (*Note: From the book, it seems unclear whether Yale just cashed out at the right time*)
    * University endowments eventually need to realize their profits in order to add to the university budget. This influences behavior of VCs because they need to get companies public / aquired in order for investors to cash out
    * When a VC wants to take a company public is not just dependent on the company itself but also on the fund investors
    * Young funds have less pressure to take companies public (book has concrete numbers). It makes sense to ask VCs what fund their investment would come from and how old that fund is
* Future funding
    * When investing into a company, VCs often also put aside money for future funding rounds
    * As an entrepreneur that may want additional future funding, it makes sense to check how successful a VC was so far, in order to figure out whether they could raise more capital in the future. Data might be hard to find, but university endowments are required to publish some
    * Most VC-funded startups go for multiple rounds of funding: Successful ones to keep scaling, others to be able to reach certain milestones
* (*Note from research after reading the chapter: The entity putting money into companies is called the general partner in the private equity world. The institutional investors or wealthy individuals providing this money are called limited partners*)
