## Appendix to Supplement: What Determines Prices in the Future and Options Markets?

* Future prices can be higher because of storage cost and opportunity cost, and potentially lower because of convenience yield (having access to the asset now)
* Other factors
    * Exercise price is what you pay for in the future. The higher the price, the lower the value of the option
    * Stock price
    * Expiration date: The longer you can exercise the option, the more valuable it is
    * Stock volatility
    * Interest rates: Influence the opportunity cost
* Black-Scholes developed a model for estimating prices based on these factors
    * A simpler, related model is the binomial model. The model converges to Black-Scholes with smaller and smaller time periods considered
    * If an investor hedged perfectly, they have a risk-less portfolio. Whether the market goes up or down, they get the same payoff either from options or from their stock
    * Such a strategy is risk-free, so it should yield the same as risk-free interest rates, meaning that is how the option needs to be priced
    * Equation systems can be described and solved to figure out this price
