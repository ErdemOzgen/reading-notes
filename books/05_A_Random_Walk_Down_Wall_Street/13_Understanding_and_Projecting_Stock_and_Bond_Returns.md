### 13. Handicapping the Financial Race: A Primer in Understanding and Projecting Returns from Stocks and Bonds

* In the long run, equity return can be approximated by adding initial dividend yield and growth rate (all in %). That empirically seems to work well
* Depending on how optimistic the market is, price-earning and price-dividend ratios can vary a lot
* Interest rates affect prices. When they are
    * high: Higher dividends and lower price-earning multiples, to make stocks attractive again
    * low: Stocks become more attractive, so dividends decrease and price-earning multiples increase
* Tax rates on long-term capital gains on stocks are quite a bit lower than the maximum income tax rate for dividend yields. Capital gain sales can also be timed much better. This has lead companies to eventually buy back their stock rather than to give out dividends
* Bond returns are easier to predict (either they are deterministic, or they depend on interest rates). This is assuming that bonds are held to maturity
* Inflation is bad if you are a bond investor. Returns on new bonds will adapt to the new inflation rate but you are still stuck with old bonds. Stocks should not suffer under inflation
* P/E multiplies can be used as one signal of predicting long-term returns of the market. Depending on recession or not, P/E multiplies are low or high
* CAPE
    * Cyclically adjusted P/E
    * Price divided by the average earnings of the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation
    * Gives a better insight into the long-term earning power of a company / market and on whether it is appropriately priced
