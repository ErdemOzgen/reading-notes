## Part Three: The New Investment Technology

#### 8. Modern Portfolio Theory

* Financial risk is often defined as the variance of expected returns
* A security whose returns are always close to the average yields little risk, while uncertain returns are risky
* Alternative is one-sided variance: We only compute squared deviations for returns below the average. Surprises in the other direction are positive
* These metrics are computed on the companyâ€™s returns of the last few years
* For well-diversified portfolios, the returns are often symmetric (in the picture normally-distributed). For individual stocks this is not the case
* More risk leads to more potential returns. Investing in small companies yields more risk and higher average returns
* Diversifying means selecting stocks that are not too correlated. That way, if one goes down, the other might go up
* Even slightly positive correlation reduces risk, as long as it is not a perfect correlation
* It is only possible to reduce risk to a certain point. There is always a chance that the market just completely crashes
* Investing across several countries can reduce risk
* Index of Europa, Austrasia, far east developed nations had higher returns than US 500, but also more volatility
* With increased globalization, international markets become more correlated which makes it harder to spread risk
