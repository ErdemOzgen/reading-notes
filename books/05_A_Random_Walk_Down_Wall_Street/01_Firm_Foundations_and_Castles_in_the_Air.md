## Part One: Stocks and Their Value

### 1. Firm Foundations and Castles in the Air

* *Random walk*: next steps cannot be predicted based on previous ones
* Taken to the extreme, on wall street it would mean that a monkey that randomly select stocks would on average do as well as anyone else
* Academics used to think something like this is the case while professional traders were of the entirely opposite opinion. Something in-between seems to be the case: Stocks are predictable to a small degree only
* Financial analysts developed two techniques for this: *fundamental* and *technical analysis*
* Academics created several versions of the random-walk theory and a theory called the *new investment technology*, which defines a concept called *betas*
* Investing is necessary to not lose money as long as there is inflation
* An average inflation rate of 4% increases prices over 50 years by 7x
* Investing: Purchasing assets to gain reasonably predictable income
* Speculating: Buys assets and hopes for short-term gain, closer to gambling

#### The Firm-Foundation Theory

* Each investment instrument, stock or real estate e.g., has an intrinsic value
* By careful analysis the value can be estimated
* When the price of the stock falls below the intrinsic value, it makes sense to invest since the market will eventually recover
* One way of estimating the value was to look at previous dividends the investment made, discounting dividends over time

#### The Castle-Air Theory

* Adds psychological elements
* Idea: Investors actually estimate value based on how they think the market will value the investment over time
* During periods of optimism, investors build castles in the air
* Each successful investor tries to beat the crowd to soon to be popular investments
* Analogy: Readers of a newspaper vote in a beauty contest. The reader that predicts the top 6 most accurately wins a prize. It would be rational to not vote for the ones you yourself find prettiest, but for the ones you think the majority will choose
* People buy stocks because they think they will be worth more in the future
* If other people buy in, the investment pulls itself up by its own bootstraps
* Psychology like that can explain bubbles
