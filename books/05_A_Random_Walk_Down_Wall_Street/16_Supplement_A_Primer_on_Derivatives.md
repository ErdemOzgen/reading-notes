## Supplement: A Primer on Derivatives

* Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities
* The two main kinds of derivatives are futures and options. Other types build on these two
* Future: Contract to purchase (or sell) a specific asset at a specific time for a specific price
* There exist derivatives on derivatives
* (Call) Option: Gives the buyer the right to purchase a specific asset at a specific price before a certain date
* Put option: The other way around. The holder has the right to sell at a specific price up until a certain date
* Nowadays, options and futures are traded more than the actual assets themselves
* Derivatives are a kind of insurance
* Originally they allowed businesses selling products to make a guaranteed amount of money, which made it easier for them to budget
* To this day, derivatives in the US are mainly traded in Chicago
* Many derivatives now have guaranteed cash settlements. Rather than delivering the asset, money depending on the price difference is exchanged
* Derivatives can be used to speculate on some price falling or rising
* Options can be used to gamble on a bubble: As long as prices keep rising, you exercise options. When the bubble bursts, you stop buying, and only lose a smaller amount for not exercising existing ones
* Nowadays trading derivatives is a lot more organized and credit risk is lower because the ability to pay out options it is guaranteed by central entities
* In some way, buying a $500 option reduces risk because you are shielded against larger losses and can potentially earn several times your investment. However, it is also possible that you lose 100% of your investment
* Futures are riskier, in the sense that you can lose much more than you invested. Say you buy a future for $500, the price rises, and you now have to settle the difference of $5000. You lost 11x your original investment
* Buffet called derivatives “weapons of mass destruction”
* Transaction costs can really add up
* It is possible to buy options for a higher selling point (out-of-the-money), at the same price as currently (at-the-money), or below (in-the-money). The less you insure, the cheaper the options
* Insuring stock you own using derivatives
    * If you are afraid stock you hold will go down, you can buy put options to insure yourself. This is rather expensive
    * Similarly you can buy sell options. This is generally better to insure yourself against smaller changes (stock values changes by at most +/-20%), but in the worst case of the stock completely dropping you are not insured as nobody will want to exercise the option
* Naked writing
    * Selling put options without having the stock available
    * If the other person does not exercise, profits are made (from the premium and potentially from selling stock that was bought in the meantime)
    * If the other person exercises, losses can be enormous
    * Brokers require putting up margin to show one is able to fulfill the obligations
* Price differences in futures are sometimes paid out as they accrue
* It can make sense to buy futures without speculating
    * Index funds sometimes purchase Should S&P 500 futures to invest a temporary influx of funds
    * If you hold one stock you are particularly excited about but are afraid that the general market might go down, you could buy S&P 500 futures
* Princeton Student Investor club: Started with 2000, made 150 profit in a few years, 900 of the remaining profit was eaten away by transaction costs and taxes
* Many investment advisors recommend that individuals do not trade with securities. The author advises only trading in three situations
    * You invest 95% of your money as recommended before, and use the other 5% for gambling on derivatives because you want to pick some stocks yourself. You should expect that it is fully possible to just lose all of that money
    * A significant amount of your portfolio consist of stocks that appreciated a lot recently but that you are worried will do worse in the future. You could sell and lose a lot of your portfolio to capital gain tax. An alternative could be buying call options that would cover your losses
    * You want to sell off a big portfolio but it will take time do so, and you are afraid the market might crash in the mean time. You can buy options to insure yourself against a huge market crash. That way, for a small cost you limit how much you could lose before everything is sold
* Options for less volatile stock are cheaper
* The longer the options are worth for, the more expensive they are
