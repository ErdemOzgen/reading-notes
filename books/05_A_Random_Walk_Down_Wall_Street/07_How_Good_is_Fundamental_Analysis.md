### 7. How Good is Fundamental Analysis? The Efficient-Market Hypothesis

* There are multiple reasons why stock values are hard to predict
    * Random events
    * Dubious earning reports
    * Errors made by analysts
    * The best analysists change positions (e.g. trade themselves rather than to just analzyse)
    * Conflict of interest between research and investment banking sections
* Professionally managed funds rarely outperform broadly investing into the market
* If a professionally managed fund was successful in one decade, it was rarely also successful in the next
* Sometimes they invest into a bubble, meaning high returns for a few years only to crash afterwards
* *Semi-strong efficient-market hypothesis* (*EMH*): No public information helps analysists select undervalued securities. The idea is that the market price already reflects any public information
* *Strong efficient-market hypothesis*: Absolutely nothing helps in predicting, not even insider information
* *Weak efficient-market hypothesis*: Past stock prices are not predictive of future ones
* Weak EMH states that technical analysis, going by past stock prices, is not helpful
* (Semi-)strong EMH states that fundamental analysis, analysing everything else, does not help either
* EMH does not state that stocks are random but that the market always corrects itself quickly
* High-frequency trading (HFT)
    * Follows a long tradition of making trading quicker
    * There's an argument to be made that HFT is a net positive for most people since it eliminates market inefficiencies more quickly
    * Ensures ETFs have a price corresponding to their individual stocks
