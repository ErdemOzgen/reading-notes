### 4. The Explosive Bubbles of the Early 2000s

* Internet bubble
    * Ratio of profits to share prices was out of control
    * Even companies that are now very valuable, such as Amazon, lost 99% of their share price as a result
    * Chinese wall of wall street firms is supposed to separate their investment banking section (which works for corporate clients) from the research section (which works for investors)
    * Since internet companies often did not have revenue, wall street started making up other metrics, most of which did not correlate to future earnings
    * The key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or how much it will grow, but just how much it will generate profits
* US housing bubble
    * Some time ago mortgages worked like this: the bank loaned money to trustworthy individuals and held those loans until they were repaid. This way the banks had an incentive not hand out too many loans
    * In the new system, banks sold loans to investment banks. These packaged loans and started trading them
    * Insurances could be bought for those packages
    * However, everything came crashing down because banks handed out too many risky loans and the insurances were not prepared to handle that
    * After the crash, many houses were worth less than the mortgage people still had to pay for them
* The market eventually corrects any irrationality
