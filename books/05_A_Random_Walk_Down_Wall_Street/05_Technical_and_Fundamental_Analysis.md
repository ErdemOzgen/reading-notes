## Part Two: How the Pros Play the Biggest Game in Town


### 5. Technical and Fundamental Analysis
* Technical analysis
    * Stems from castles-in-the-air theory
    * Idea: market is 90% psychological, 10% logical
    * Analysis of past price courses (by "chartists")
    * Everything important is already summarised by charts since the market responds to earnings etc.
    * Trends are most important
    * Chartists are now called technicians and use specialised computer programs
* Fundamental analysis
    * Stems from firm-foundations theory
    * Idea: market is 90% logical, 10% psychological
    * Little care of price courses, mostly concerned with intrinsic value
    * Company assets, expected growth of earnings and assets, risk are considered
    * Roughly 90% of people on wall street are fundamentalists
* Reasons why technical analysis might work
    * Mass psychology makes trends perpetuate themselves
    * Unequal access to information
    * Investors often underreact when earnings come out
* Reasons why technical analysis might not work
    * Chartists only buy after a trend is established, thus they might be too late
    * The more people use a technique the more its value depreciates
* Fundamental analysis determinants
    * Companies are clustered into industries, which are studied by analysts
    * 1: expected growth rate
    * 2: expected divident payout
    * 3: risk
    * 4: market interest rates (maybe something other than stocks offers higher returns)
* Rule of 72: it takes 72/x years to double your money at an interest rate of x%
* P/E: price-earnings multiplier
* Risk can be measured by flunctuation in stock price or earnings, though this is not a great way to do so
* Fundamental rules of evaluating securities
    * Rule 1: A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a larger growth rate of dividends and earnings
    * Rule 2: A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price the larger the proportion of earnings that are paid out as dividends
    * Rule 3: Less risky stock is worth more
    * Rule 4: Lower interest rates justify higher stock prices
* Three important caveats
    * Expectations about the future are only estimates
    * Precise numbers cannot be computed based on the available information
    * It is unclear how much to pay for growth
* Using fundamental and technical analysis together
    * Rule 1: Buy only companies that are expected to have above-average earning growth for the next 5 years
    * Rule 2: Never pay more for a stock than its firm foundation of value
    * Rule 3: Look for stocks with stories that investors might build castles in the air with
* PEG: P/E to growth ratio
* In high growth situations, there is often a double bonus: earnings and increased price. When growth does not happen losses can be doubly heavy in the same way
