#### 9. Reaping Rewards By Increasing Risk

* Diversification cannot eliminate all risk since stocks are partly moving up and down together
* *Systematic risk* is risk that arises from the variability of stocks in general
* *Beta* is a measure for estimating this based on past stock movements: Comparison of individual stock to movements of the entire market
* A beta of x means that if the entire market moves by 1, the individual stock moves by x
* High-beta stock are considered aggressive investments, low-beta stock defensive ones
* It is not possible to eliminate systematic risk by diversifying
* *Unsystematic risk* is risk about an individual company, e.g. whether it finds new natural resources or whether it gets involved in a scandal
* Unsystematic risk can be diversified away
* Capital-asset pricing model
    * Market should reward investors for systematic risk, not for unsystematic risk (since it can be diversified away)
    * If the market would reward unsystematic risk, it would quickly correct itself and stop rewarding it
* Beta: Covariance between stock and market index as measured on past prices
* Positive alpha: Actual return is larger than the one predicted by beta
* However, studies have shown no correlation between actual returns and beta
* Betas still do a good job at predicting relative volatility in the future
* It is worth keeping in mind that beta is generally computed based on a market index, but that does not represent the entire market (only top stocks, but there are many other assets)
* Holding stocks of the company you work for is especially risky â€“ if the company is in trouble, you could get penalized in salary and stock returns
* Arbitrage pricing theory (APC) also uses other variables to measure how the market moves, e.g. inflation rate, interest rate, average national income. Using statistical tests, relevant variables can be found
* Fama-French use three risk factors: APC beta, size (market capitalization), value (ratio of market to book value)
* The beta of a portfolio is the weighted beta of the individual securities
