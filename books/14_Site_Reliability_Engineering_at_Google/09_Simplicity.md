## 9. Simplicity

- > a good summary of the SRE approach to managing systems is: "At the end of the day, our job is to keep agility and stability in balance in the system.”
- (*Note: The “No Silver Bullet” essay seems to be cited quite a lot by SREs*)
- Simplicity makes it much easier to keep systems working reliably
- > French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery wrote, "perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away”
- Simplicity in software engineering could mean
    - few lines of code
    - loosely coupled components
    - rolling out many small release instead of a gigantic one, to make it easier to understand how each change impacted the system
