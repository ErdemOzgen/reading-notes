## 15. Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure

- When incidents occur, it is important to properly document them and make sure they will not happen again
- A *postmortem* is a document that serves this purpose. It describes the incident, its impact, the actions taken towards resolving it, the root causes, and follow-up actions to prevent similar incidents in the future
- Teams are expected to do postmortems after any significant incidents
- It is important that there is a blameless culture around postmortems. Otherwise people will struggle writing them
- Google did not come up with the concept of postmortems. They have long traditions in the healthcare and avionic industries where mistakes can be really costly
- > You canâ€™t "fix" people, but you can fix systems and processes to better support people making the right choices when designing and maintaining complex systems
- There should be followups to postmortems
