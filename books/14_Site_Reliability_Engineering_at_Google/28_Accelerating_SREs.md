# Part IV – Management

## 28. Accelerating SREs to On-Call and Beyond

- Elements of SRE training
    - role-playing exercises to teach people how to react
    - shadowing people that are on-call before going on-call themselves
- Rather than throwing people into the deep end to respond to tickets, it is preferable to teach them about everything in a more structured way. That gives people a good sense of the system they are meant to keep running
- Training systems should be evaluated for effectiveness
- As an SRE organization, you have to scale your humans faster than you scale your machines
