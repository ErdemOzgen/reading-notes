## 34. Conclusion

- > When you approach building a team or a system, ideally its foundation should be a set of rules or axioms that are general enough to be immediately useful, but that will remain relevant in the future
- The SRE organization at Google massively improved and scaled over the past decade
- Think of how plane travel changed: 100 years ago there was no redundancy in plane systems, the pilot handled many jobs at the same time, and plane crashes were not uncommon. Today, it is a heavily scaled and regulated industry, with nearly no crashes (especially when compared to cars). The craft of SRE evolved similarly
