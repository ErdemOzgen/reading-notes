## 29. Dealing with Interrupts

- *Operational load* is any work performed to keep a system functional. These could come in the form of pages or tickets
- Google tracks these carefully with a bunch of metrics
- The feeling of flow can easily be killed be interrupts, which is why it is important for an on-call person to handle these interrupts instead
- > when a person is concentrating full-time on interrupts, interrupts stop being interrupts
- > A person should never be expected to be on-call and also make progress on projects (or anything else with a high context switching cost)
- Randomly assigning tickets to people in the team is a bad idea because it leads to more unnecessary interrupts. Instead, route them to someone on-call for tickets
- People should either not have to deal with interrupts or fully concentrate on handling interrupts
