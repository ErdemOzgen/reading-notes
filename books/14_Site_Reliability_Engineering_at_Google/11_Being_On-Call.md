## 11. Being On-Call

- Someone *on-call* needs to respond to urgent tasks that need to be done and problems that need to be solved
- How quickly they need to respond depends on the SLO and on whether the issue is user-facing. At Google, it is typical that you need to respond within 5 minutes when it comes to user-facing issues, and within 30 minutes for less urgent problems
- The person on-call is equipped with a device they can be paged with. This might be a phone
- Multi-site teams are useful so that nobody needs to do night shifts
- When issues occur, it is important to give the on-call enough time afterwards to document things (e.g. to write a postmortem)
- Google compensates people extra for being on-call
- It is important to consider how people might get stressed out by being on-call. That stress can be reduced by
   - Having clear escalation paths
   - Well-defined ways of dealing with issues
   - A blameless postmortem culture
- Google has an internal tool for coordinating and documenting incidents
