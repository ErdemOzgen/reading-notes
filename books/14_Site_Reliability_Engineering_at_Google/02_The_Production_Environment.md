## 2. The Production Environment

- *Machine*: A piece of hardware
- *Server*: A software implementing some service
- A server can run on any machine
- Google data center topology, in increasing size: machine, rack, row, cluster, data center, campus
- Scheduling: Borg
    - *Borg* is Google's cluster operating system
    - It schedules *jobs* to run on the cluster. Each job can consist of *tasks*, which can have different hardware requirements
    - Since Borg might schedule the job on any machine, one cannot depend on IP addresses anymore. Instead, *BNS* (*Borg naming service*) addresses are used, which just refer to the cluster and job by name
- Storage
    - There are several options for permanent storage
    - In increasing order of abstraction level
        - *D*: A file server running on each cluster
        - *Colossus*: Offers filesystem abstractions on top, so that you can address files by name instead of location. It also offers replication and encryption on top
        - *Bigtable* (No-SQL), *Spanner* (SQL) and *Blobstore* interfaces make it easier to interact with large amounts of data
- Networking
    - Google has various networking and load balancing systems
- Lock system
    - *Chubby* provides a filesystem-like API for locks
    - It uses the Paxos protocol
    - Chubby is for example used when multiple replicas compete to perform a specific action
- Alterting
    - *Borgmon* scrapes logging data from various servers
    - It allows visualizing this data or setting up alerts based on it
- Software
    - RPC calls: *Stubby*
    - Data transferred is stored in protocol buffers
