## 13. Emergency Response

- The first part of the chapter describes three different Google outages and how SREs reacted. These were caused by a proactive test, a configuration change gone wrong, and by a faulty automated turndown of a system. SREs reacted calmly, debugged the issue, and pulled in more people as necessary
- Outages can be stressful, but it is important to keep calm and follow the playbook
- What Google SREs learned from dealing with outages
  - Keep track of the history. It is important to document what happened in order to learn from it
  - Proactively ask questions like "what happens if X fails", even if you think this is rather unlikely
  - Encourage proactive testing of systems
