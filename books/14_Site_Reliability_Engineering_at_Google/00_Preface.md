# Preface

- *SRE*: *Site reliability engineer*
    - *Engineer*: This profession should follow engineering principles
    - *Reliability*: The goal is to keep services running as well as possible
    - *Site*: Initially this was just about making sure [google.com](http://google.com) runs smoothly, so the word *site* was used. Nowadays it seems like *service* would be a better choice
