## 14. Managing Incidents

- Elements of managing an incident well
  - Responsibilities are clearly assigned
  - There is a command leader that coordinates the incidence response
  - Stakeholders are updated
  - There is a planning role supporting the operation by taking care of filing bugs, ordering dinner, arranging handoffs, etc
- The most important thing really is to have a process before the incident. Spontaneously coming up with one generally works badly and takes too much time
