## 26. Data Integrity: What You Read Is What You Wrote

- Data integration means data is available and accurate
- To what level this needs to be the case is highly dependent on the application
- Backup vs archive
    - *Backup*: Something that can be loaded back into the application to restore some previous state
    - *Archive*: Safekeep data to satisfy auditing, discovery and compliance needs
- Soft / lazy deletion
    - For some applications, it can be a good idea to let users *soft delete* data, meaning it is marked as deleted but the user can still undo the action
    - Database elements marked as deleted are ignored by everything else
    - After a while these elements do fully get deleted
    - Whether this is a useful feature very much depends on the use case
- Backups
    - You should have strategies for regularly taking them and being able to quickly apply them
    - Make sure to regularly test your backup systems, especially when they have not been needed for a long time
    - Google has backups stored on tape for especially lasting backups
- Have systems in place to detect data manipulation early on. The sooner you know about data loss, the better you can deal with it
- Principles SREs apply to data integrity
    - Beginner's mind: Try to understand everything
    - Trust by verify
    - Hope is not a strategy
    - Assume every strategy fails eventually
    - Revisit and reexamine periodically
