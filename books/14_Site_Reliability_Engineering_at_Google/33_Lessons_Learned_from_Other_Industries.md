## 33. Lessons Learned from Other Industries

- There are some other industries where reliability is super important. These include fields such as:
  - Defense systems
  - Lifeguard
  - Eye surgery
  - Telecommunications
  - Medical applications
  - Automated trading in finance
  - Air traffic planning
  - Nuclear plants
- Google hired a bunch of people that previously worked in these industries
- It is important to learn from these industries since they have a lot of prior experience
- The chapter analyzes learnings from and standards in these industries in four different categories
  1. Preparedness and Disaster Testing: Depending on the industry, organizations perform offline analyses, simulations and live drills
  2. Postmortem Culture: Some industries are heavily regulated, and require detailed reports on outages or near misses
  3. Automating Away Repetitive Work and Operational Overhead: Some industries trust humans more than machines. Others employ automation selectively
  4. Structured and Rational Decision Making: Some industries *never* want to change running systems since reliability is so important. Others have very strict processes for it. It seems like Google errs much more on the side of flexible iteration here
- > Decisions should be informed rather than prescriptive
- (*Note: I found this chapter to be quite fascinating and I wonder why it is nearly the last chapter of the book. It is so interesting that so many different industries face such similar issues and all developed their ways of dealing with them*)
