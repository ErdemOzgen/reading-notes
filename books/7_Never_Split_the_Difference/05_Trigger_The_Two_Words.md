## 5. Trigger The Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation

* *Behavioral Change Stairway Model* (*BCSM*): The FBI’s model for going from listening to influencing behavior in five stages: Active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, behavioral change
* A lot of the rewards we receive are conditional on us doing something. That’s why we often calibrate what we are saying in a way that let’s us expect the maximum possible gain, instead of just behaving the way we would truly behave
* > The sweetest two words in any negotiation are “That’s right"
* People have to *own* the conclusion instead of just saying “yes” to it
* A *summary*: Paraphrasing the other person’s opinion and then labeling their feelings about it
* What do you tell people when you want them to quit bothering you? Usually “You’re right” (*Note: Interesting how close that is to “That’s right”*)
