## 3. Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It

* > Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window
* *Empathy*: Understanding the other person’s feelings and being able to vocalize them
* *Sympathy*: Agreeing with those feelings
* *Tactical empathy*: Understanding where those feelings are coming from
* Labeling
    * The act of recognizing and verbalizing the other person’s feelings
    * Makes the other people feel acknowledged
    * Might seem awkward at first, but usually people do not notice
    * Usually starts with “It seems/looks/sounds like you…”
    * You label the underlying emotion, not the visible one (e.g. when someone is visibly grumpy for not seeing you often)
* The best way to deal with negativity is to just observe it. Then label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, solution-based thoughts
* Accusation audit
    * At the beginning, lay out all negative points that the other person might complain about
    * This makes the other person feel more acknowledged, allows you to take control of the situation and to drift the remaining conversation to more positive topics
