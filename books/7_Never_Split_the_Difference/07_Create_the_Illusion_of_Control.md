## 7. Create the Illusion of Control

* Well-calibrated, open-ended questions can make the other person share information without you demanding it. In hostage negotiation this was useful because demanding the information would be aggressive and would require something in return
* “Who”, “when”, “where” usually lead to fact sharing as they are not open-ended enough
* “How” and “what” are better
* “Why” can work, but can also backfire because it might sound like an accusation. A lot of times you can phrase “why” questions using something like “what” though
* You need to control your own emotions if you want to influence someone else’s
* Popular strategy of Japanese business people negotiating with foreigners: Use a translator, even if both parties speak English. This gives them more time to think about their reply (*Note: I wonder if it's a good idea to tell translators to really take their time then*)
* Do not engage in verbal assault, even if it is in response
* In conversations, the listening person is usually more powerful as they are the one getting information
