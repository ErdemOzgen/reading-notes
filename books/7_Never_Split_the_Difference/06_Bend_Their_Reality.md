## 6. Bend Their Reality

* Compromises are socially acceptable and we are told that splitting the difference is a good thing to do. In fact it’s not, because the other party’s offer might be completely out of line, or because a compromise benefits neither party
* Deadlines are usually arbitrary and can be moved
* Increasing specificity of threats is a sign that they are becoming more realistic
* Knowing the other party’s deadline gives you a huge negotiation advantage
* Hiding your own deadlines is not an advantage though. If your deadline is unknown, the chance of not reaching an agreement in time gets bigger
* Our brain both processes emotions and makes decisions in a similar part
* Humans dislike unfairness. Apes also do
* It’s beneficial if you’re seen as a fair negotiator
* Just because decisions are irrational doesn’t mean there aren’t consistent patterns behind them
* *Certainty Effect*: People prefer sure outcomes over probabilistic ones that are better in expectation
* Strong leverage: Convince the other person they will lose something if the deal falls through
* Practical tips
    1. Anchor the other party’s emotions: E.g. when you need to give them a low offer, anchor their expectation at getting nothing otherwise
    2. Generally let the other party give you the first offer: Neither party has perfect information, and by giving the first offer, information is shared. It is possible that this offer is much higher than anything you were expecting. The exception to this rule are situations where you have really good information about where the offer should be. In this case you can give the first number to anchor something and shorten negotiations
    3. Give a range: Statistically, people that give ranges end up with higher offers. That is even the case when they gave a *bolstering range*, i.e. they were actually just hoping for the lower end of the range. It seems the seeing a range with large numbers makes the other person subconsciously think of higher counter offers too
    4. Don’t forget about non-monetary terms
    5. Use odd numbers. People are less likely to move them
    6. Surprise the other party with a gift (*Note: This one feels like it could go wrong. I think maybe a better way to phrase this is to show consideration for the other person. In some circumstances this could be material, in others not*)
* When people are asked to estimate what 8 x 7 x … x 2 x 1 is, they give a higher answer than when asked about 1 x 2 x … x 7 x 8
* If someone gives you guidance, they will watch whether you follow it
