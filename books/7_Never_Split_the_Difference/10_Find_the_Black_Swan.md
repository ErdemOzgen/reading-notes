## 10. Find the Black Swan

* Never in US history was a hostage killed on the first deadline – until it happened
* *Black swans*: Unknown unknowns that when uncovered fundamentally change the negotiation dynamics
* Three types of leverage
    * *Positive*: You have something they want
    * *Negative*: You can make them lose something. This can be much stronger leverage due to loss aversion. Using this leverage requires being more subtle though as it can come across as too aggressive
    * *Nominative*: Some leverage that is based on the other party’s morals
* *Paradox of power*: The more forceful someone suggests something to us, the more we push back
* *Similarity principle*: We like people that are similar to us
* People are favorable towards requests that involve a “because", even if the reason does not provide much new information
* When people seem crazy to us, this often often because they lack information, because they have constraints or because they have are interests in other things
* Face-to-face time can be really valuable for negotiations because you get information based on body languages and quicker reactions
* Using background listeners can be useful (*Note: The context her was hostage negotiation where they had phone calls*)
* Motivation for finding black swans: If you do not know where the treasure is, you cannot dig it up
* Closing words
    * Negotiation is not about winning *against* the other party
    * Clear and honest conflict can be positive: It forces both parties to evaluate what they really care about
