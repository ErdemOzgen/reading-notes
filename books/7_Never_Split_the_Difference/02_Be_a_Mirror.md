## 2. Be a Mirror

* Mindset of discovery is important in negotiation: Your goal should be to extract as much useful information as possible
* Hostage negotiation: The less important someone makes themselves, the more important they are (and vice-versa)
* Going too fast is a common mistake in negotiations. This is problematic because it might mean that the other person does not feel listened to
* It doesn’t just matter what we do or say, but also how we behave, e.g. in what voice we talk or what our body language signals
* > When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve
* Mirroring
    * Speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo
    * Usually unconscious
    * It’s a sign we are bonding with someone
    * Why it works: We are drawn to what we know, and fear what we do not know
* FBI mirroring
    * Usually about speech, not anything else
    * Repeat the last three words of what the other person said. This makes them expand on what they just said
* Mirroring works better than positive replies. This was shown in a study where the tips of waiters who tried both methods were compared. Waiters who tried mirroring got 70% more tips
* The FBI has negotiators specializing on closing negotiations
* > Being right isn’t the key to a successful negotiation – having the right mindset is
* Instead of asking “What do you mean by that?” you can mirror and repeat what the other person just said
