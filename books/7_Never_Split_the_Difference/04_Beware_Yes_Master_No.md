## 4. Beware “Yes”– Master “No”

* Telemarketer selling technique: Ask lots of questions where the person phoned will obviously answer “yes"
* > “Yes” and “Maybe” are often worthless. But “No” always alters the conversation
* “No” starts negotiations because it often means something like “I’m not yet ready to agree”, “You are making me uncomfortable”, “I want something else "
* “Yes” can mean confirmation, counterfeit (i.e. they were not comfortable to say “no”), commitment (stronger than confirmation)
* We often value “yes” too much because we assume it means commitment, e.g. in the telemarketer example. However, it is actually the no that is valuable
* Ways of getting to an early no
    * State something that’s clearly incorrect
    * Ask the other party for something they don’t want
* Niceness is often meaningless because it could mean anything. That’s bad for negotiation because it does not yield any information. Getting the other person to disagree ("no") and show their boundaries does give you information though
