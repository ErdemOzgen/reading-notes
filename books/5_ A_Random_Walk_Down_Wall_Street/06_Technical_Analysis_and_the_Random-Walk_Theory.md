### 6. Technical Analysis and the Random-Walk Theory

* Strategies of technicians have been tested in simulations on old stock courses. They did not work well. Based on the previous stock course, prices behaved too randomly
* Even a price course created by a random coin looks like it has some pattern to it: It is easy to mistake randomness for pattern
* Random walk in math: sequence of randomly generated numbers
* If stock prices are a random walk, then technical analysis is as scientific as technical analysis
* Baseline to compare against is buy-and-hold, and technical analysis does not consistently outperform it
* Filter systems (e.g. automatically sell if stock drops x%) are not different to technical analysis. It has been shown that if they incur transaction costs, they generally perform worse than buy-and-hold of index funds
* Resistance area: Stock goes to x and then drops. The next time it reaches x, people are inclined to sell because they missed out last time. Now this might be a number that the stock has a harder time to beat. It is the same concept with stock hitting a low and buying (support area)
* Relative-strength system: Strategy where strong stocks are bought and weak ones are sold. There were periods where these strategies worked well, but over a long time they were not worth it
* Price-volume systems: Strategy where stock is bought when stock volume is increased and sold when the converse happens. Does not work either
* Generally the problem with many strategies based on technical analysis is that transaction costs are high
* Since many technicians are making predictions, some are due to be right some of the time. However, none has consistently beat the market
* Even if a strategy is successful, it will only be until others also come up with it. Any regularity in the market that is discovered will eventually be destroyed in the process of exploiting it
* It is in the interest of brokerage firms to hire technicians, since they will advise customers to do more active trading, thus generating more commissions
* 95% of market gains in a 30-year period happened during 90 of the ~7500 trading days
* If someone invested $1 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1900, it would have grown to $290 by early 2013. If that person missed the best 5 days of each year, the $1 investment would be worth less than a penny now
* Holding money and taking it out of the market a lot is thus dangerous, since one might miss the days where the market moves a lot
