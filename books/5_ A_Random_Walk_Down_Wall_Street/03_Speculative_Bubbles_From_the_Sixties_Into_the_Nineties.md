### 3. Speculative Bubbles From the Sixties Into the Nineties

#### The Soaring Sixties

* Certain words in company names vastly increased their evaluation even though they did not produce anything
* Ratio of price to earnings is interesting to look at
* Synergy creates energy: The conglomerate boom
    * > Synergy is the quality of having 2 plus 2 equal 5
    * When a conglomerate is formed relative earnings can increase just because of the way the shares are divided between the original companies
    * This creates an illusion of growth
    * Like a chain letter. It works until there is nobody new to include
    * One of those companies achieved 20% growth over 10 years
* Performance comes to market: The bubble in concept stocks
    * Investors started preferring funds with a high performance, i.e. quick returns rather than long-term value
    * Having stock with an exciting concept became important
* The nifty fifty
    * To avoid speculating too much, investors invested into established companies that were known to grow most of the time, the nifty fifty
    * By doing this, their stock inflated too much
    * Even though the companies were worth something, this created another bubble
    
#### The Roaring Eighties

* The return of new issues
    * IPO: initial public offering
* The biotechnology bubble
    * Profits were considered a drawback since they might decline in the future
    * Major sellers of IPO stock are often the managers of the respective companies
