### 2. The Madness of Crowds

* Outguessing reactions of a crowd is a dangerous game
* In the 17th century a tulip bubble emerged in the Netherlands
    * Tulips were traded for huge prices and seen as an investment
    * Trading with tulips replaced other economical goods
    * Options: Guaranteed purchase to a given price at a certain time. If the price at that time is higher, one can simultaneously buy and sell, thus making a profit without having paid the price of the original purchase
    * In the end, prices collapsed within weeks. Standard tulips were virtually worth nothing anymore. Rare ones were only worth a fraction of their original price
* South Sea Company
    * People invested into companies that had no actual product
    * Prices rose and attracted more and more investors
    * In the end, directors of the companies sold their shares, realizing that they were not really worth anything, thus leading to a panic where everybody sold their shares
    * Isaac Newton: "I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not of the madness of people"
* 1920s Wall Street
    * Groups of traders worked together to artificially inflate prices
    * One person bought a lot of stocks, then traded them inside the group to create the impression that something big is about to happen with the stock
    * Traders paid people working at the stock exchange to receive more information about who placed what buy/sell orders
    * Selling short
        * Makes money if prices fall
        * You sell stock you currently do not own in the expectation of buying it at a lower price later
        * Betting on price decrease
    * The head of Chase sold Chase stock short. By doing that others panicked, the price decreased, and he made a handsome profit
    * In history so far, sharp increases in stock prices were rarely followed by a gradual return to price stability
