## Part Four: A Practical Guide for Random Walkers and Other Investors

### 12. A Fitness Manual for Random Walkers and Other Investors

* > Trust in time rather than in timing
* > the only thing worse than being dead is having outlived the money you put aside for retirement
* By investing you can not get rich quickly, but you can get poor quickly
* Avoid complex financial products
* Variable annuity
    * Insurance for investments
    * Avoids taking huge losses
    * Not worth it if you live long enough to wait until the market recovers. Potentially worth it if you are incredibly rich and want to optimize on taxes
* Short-term investing
    * Money-market mutual funds: 1-5% interest rate in early 2000s but nearly 0 now
    * Bank CDs (certificates of deposit): Penalties for early withdrawal ([http://bankrate.com](http://bankrate.com))
    * T-bills: Government backed, less risk but smaller returns than bank CDs
    * Tax-exempt money-market-funds: Attractive in states with a high income tax rate
* Tax-efficient investing
    * IRA (Individual retirement account): 5500 per year can be invested and deducted from taxes, unless you have a very high income. People age 50+ that did not invest when they were younger can put in 6500
    * Roth IRA: While IRAs offer an immediate tax reduction, Roth IRA offer tax-free withdrawals. That is an advantage if you might be in a higher tax class when you want to withdraw the money
    * IRAs can be converted into Roth IRAs
    * Rule of thumb: If you are young and in a low tax bracket, Roth IRAs are usually worth it. If your tax rate is going to be lower in retirement, IRAs are preferable
    * 401k retirement plan: 17,500 per year can be contributed and do not count as taxable income. Many employers match part of that money. For people over 50+, the limit is 22,500
    * SEP IRA: For self-employed people, max(25%, 52,000) can be contributed
    * There are special plans for saving money for college (e.g. â€œ529")
* It is important to come up with goals and an investment strategy before actually investing
    * Depending on income, age, and tax bracket, one will want to invest differently
    * High tax bracket: tax-exempt bonds, low-dividend stock (so taxes have to be paid when the stock is sold but not on dividends before)
    * Low tax bracket: taxable bonds, high-dividend stock
    * Depending on age, a different amount of risk
* Real estate
    * Inflating prices are a good bet as long as the population is increasing
    * Not as efficiently priced as stocks because per property there are fewer people interested
    * Property tax is deductible from income tax, rent is not
    * Gains in the value of the house are tax-exempt
    * REITs (real estate investment trusts): Invest in sets of properties, similar to stocks. Some funds try to diversify these sets for you
* Bonds
    * There are different options depending on how the return is paid out (at the end, regularly) and how one wants to pay taxes
    * Tax-exempt bonds are issued by governments
    * As of 2014: Long-term corporate bonds yield about 4% (tax-free) or 4.5% (taxable)
    * Rating services give estimates for risk on bonds
    * One should favor bonds with protections against early buying back. Otherwise you might be paid out less (e.g. if interest rates drop and the issuer wants to use that)
    * TIPS: Return is guaranteed to be adjusted to inflation. This is nice for diversification since stocks usually drop in value when inflation is strong. However, TIPS are tax-inefficient and best used in retirement plans
    * Even if short-term bonds give better rates than long-term ones, the long-term ones might be superior: Maybe the short-term rates are going to be much lower the next time you want to buy a bond
* Others
    * Gold: Prices jumped a lot, might be good for diversification during times of strong inflation, but it is really not clear
    * Diamonds, collectibles: Hard to estimate value, it is a gamble, usually more people try to sell than buy
    * > most people who think they are collecting profit, are really collecting trouble
* Investment cost: Keep it low, you get what you do *not* pay for
* Diversification is really important: Think of the Enron employee that only kept Enron stock
