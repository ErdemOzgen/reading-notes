### 10. Behavioral Finance

* So far we assumed that people act rationally on markets
* *Behavioral finance* is a discipline originating from psychology that questions this
* *Arbitage* is buying undervalued stock and selling overvalued ones, thus evening out market irrationalities
* Reasons for irrational behavior
    * Overconfidence
        * Statistically most people are too confident in many things, especially men
        * The more individual investors trade, the worse they do
        * Hindsight bias
        * We tend to remember successes more than failures
        * People often attribute failures to other external events and successes to their own ability
        * > It's far more profitable to sell advice than to take it
        * Overconfidence can be a reason that growth stock is overvalued
    * Biased judgements
        * It is easy to mistake randomness for pattern and the other way around
        * Even if something is completely random, we might feel like we are in control
        * One of the reasons why people can choose numbers in a lottery is that it makes them feel more in control, even though it does not change probabilities
        * We often forget about base rate probabilities: If we think someone looks similar to a criminal based on representativeness, we also need to factor in the base probability for being a criminal (Bayes' rule)
    * Herding
        * Groups tend to make better decisions than individuals
        * For example, this is one of the reasons why markets are more efficient than central planing committees
        * Group think is not just peer pressure but actually changes the way we think about things
        * > There's nothing so disturbing to one's well-being and judgement as to see a friend get rich
        * Herding is why people tend to buy similar stock to people they know
        * Average returns in the stock market have been generous, but returns to the average investor have been poor, about 5%. It has been suggesting that this is due to timing penalties
    * Loss aversion
        * People generally consider losses to be far more undesirable than the equivalent gains to be desirable
        * Experimentally, loses are considered 2.5 times worse
        * The way questions about gains and losses are framed has a huge impact. It's why doctors ask for decisions based on survival probabilities
    * Pride and regret
        * Disposition effect: People sell successful stock and hold onto unsuccessful one
        * Nobody wants to tell others about selling unsuccessful stock
* Many people do not join 401k plans because they feel like they are losing money. If the framing is changed to having to actively opt-out, this is very different
* Sometimes the market remains irrational longer than an arbitrageur can stay solvent
* It is not always possible to find a similar, undervalued stock to buy. In these cases, only the votes of the optimists are heard and the market stays irrational
* Most money in investing is not won on your own part but by mistakes from others
* The current period's hot investment is usually a bad one in the next time period
* Overtrading leads to higher transaction cost and taxes
* Sell losing stock, not winning one
    * The decision not to sell is the same decision as to buy at the current price
    * In the US it reduces taxes
* Buying IPOs has been a bad idea historically
    * As an individual investor, you generally don't get the IPO price, but the one that's inflated after it starts selling
    * After 6 months insiders can sell their stock and the stock often tanks then
* The US stock market averaged 9% returns, but with many bad years in-between. Always having such a return in each year is virtually impossible
