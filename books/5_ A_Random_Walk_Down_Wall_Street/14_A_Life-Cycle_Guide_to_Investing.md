### 14. A Life-Cycle Guide to Investing

* The investment strategy to follow should heavily depend on one's age. The older you get, the less risk you are willing to take (less income from salary, less time to wait for better markets)
* The mix of asset types is the most important part in designing a portfolio (90% depends on the mix, 10% on specific stock choices)
* Principles for asset-allocation
    * Risk and return are related
    * Risk depends on how long you hold stock / bonds. Returns vary less when the security is held for a longer time
    * Dollar-cost averaging can be useful but is somewhat controversial
    * Rebalancing can reduce risk
    * Attitude towards risk and capacity for risk are distinct
* The longer you hold stock, the more they outperform bonds (1 year 60.2% of the time outperform bonds, 30 years 99.4%). The longer the time you hold onto your investments, the more stock you should have in your portfolio
* Dollar-cost averaging: Invest steadily over time rather than saving up and putting everything into the market at once. This way one does not have to try to time the market and avoids investing everything just before the market falls
* Rebalancing assets once a year can make sense if the value of a certain type of asset climbs much more quickly than the one of others. For example, say an investor decides on a 60-40 mix of stocks and bonds. If the stocks do well, and the ratio becomes 70-30 a year later, it would make sense to rebalance
* > Never take on the same risks in your portfolio that attach to your major source of income
* The guidelines of life-cycle investment
    * Invest according to your needs, e.g. CDs if you need to make a certain payment in the next 1-2 years
    * Recognize your tolerance for risk, psychologically and income-wise
    * Persistent savings pay off, even if each month they are rather small
* Rule of thumb: The portion of bonds should equal ones age
* By 55, one should think about how to move to assets that produce income
* For young people, that regularly invest a small sum of money, mutual funds are a necessity
* Mid-twenties: 70% stock (half US, half foreign), 15% bonds, 10% real estate (REITs), 5% cash (money-market funds or short-term bonds of 1 - 1.5 years). Ratio substantially changes from mid-40s on
* Life-cycle fund: Automatically adjusts asset mix for you as you age. Pretty much does for fees what was discussed before
* To make use of the saved up money in retirement, there are two options: Annuities and withdrawing at a safe rate
* Annuities
    * Pay a lump sum to an insurance which then guarantees a certain yearly amount of money until death
    * For heavy premiums, there are plans that
        * pay to relatives for some years if the person dies early
        * Adjust for inflation
    * There are also plans that provide a different amount of money depending on how the stock market is doing
    * Disadvantages
        * You don't leave a bequest
        * No flexible consummation: Assume both partners learn they will die early. They cannot take out all the money to travel around the world
        * Costly, especially if sold by insurance agents. You pay for fees, expenses, sales commission
        * Tax inefficient: You pay income tax instead of capital gain tax. You already pay income tax on 401k/IRA (since you have to take out some money each year in retirement), so this just increases it
    * Conclusion: Annuities are the only real guarantee that you will not outlive your money. At least partial annuitization usually makes sense
* Do it yourself
    * 4% rule: You can withdraw 4% per year and chances are if you live to 100 you still have money left
    * You are likely to have returns higher than 4%, but withdrawing less let's you handle inflation and takes care of recessions
    * You can adapt the 4% depending on inflation
    * Take out money in a way that leaves the asset mix intact (e.g. if stocks do extraordinarily well, take more money out of them)
    * Tap assets to defer paying more income tax. 401k and IRAs have required minimum withdrawals that you pay income tax on, so you should use that money first
    * Roth IRAs have no required withdrawal rate and can be passed onto heirs tax-free
    * In very old age it is probably fine to withdraw more than 4%
    * The 4% rule might chance in the future. In the past it used to be a 4.5% rule
