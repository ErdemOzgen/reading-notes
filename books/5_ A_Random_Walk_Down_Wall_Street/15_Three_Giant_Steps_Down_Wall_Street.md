### 15. Three Giant Steps Down Wall Street

* Three ways of buying stock
    * No-Brainer: Buy shares of various broad-based index funds or indexed ETFs. Very simple and the market pulls you along
    * Do-It-Yourself: Pick your own stock. Fun and dangerous (as outlined in the previous 400 pages)
    * Substitute-Player: Choose a professional investment manager. They will probably buy managed mutual funds
* For all investors: The core investment should be into indexed funds or ETFs
* No-Brainer
    * S&P 500 contains about 75% of the value of all common stocks in the US
    * Vanguard 500 Index Trust purchases all these 500 stocks in proportion to their value (BlackRock and others do something similar)
    * Expense of such funds: 1/20 of 1% of assets
    * Average managed fund cost is about 1% per year. They have management cost and higher trading cost (since they trade more whereas index funds only trade when absolutely necessary)
    * Since managed funds do not beat the average but have higher costs, they have to underperform
    * Switching between securities means immediate capital gain tax, whereas this can be deferred in index funds. Earlier realization reduces net returns
    * Index funds are also more predictable
    * Some managed funds try to time the market, which does not work. Even if some could, it would be impossible to pick the correct managed fund
    * Broad diversification rules out extraordinary gains and losses
    * > Guaranteed mediocracy
    * Index funds pool money of many investors and minimize transaction fees by trading in large blocks
    * Many big companies and institutions invest their cash reserves into index funds
    * Index funds collect dividends for you and send them to you a few times a year
    * All of this allows you to obtain the market average return with little expense and work
    * S&P 500 consists of large companies. If one only goes for one index fund, it should be one that emulates a broader index, such as Russel 3000, Wilshire 5000 Total, CRSP,  MSCI US Broad Market
    * Wilshire 5000 includes all publicly traded companies in the US. Index funds for this are called total stock market portfolios
    * There are index funds for entire regions
    * Index funds are more tax efficient in that little is traded while holding onto the security, so capital gain taxes are mostly only paid when selling the index fund. That is a huge advantage because the money can grow in the meantime
    * ETFs: Can be more tax and management cost efficient because they can make in-kind redemptions. However they incur transaction costs and are thus not good to be traded with quickly
    * If you want to buy individual stock, index the core of your investments to reduce risk
* Do-It-Yourself
    * Rules for successful stock selection
        * Pick stocks that consistently (5+ years) have above-average earnings growth
        * Do not buy stocks that clearly seem overvalued
        * It helps to buy stocks that investors can build castles in the air with
        * Trade as little as possible: Ride with winners and sell losers
* Substitute-Player
    * Choosing someone to manage your portfolio for you is just as much a gamble as selecting stocks is
    * At least somewhat predictive: Expense ratios and turnover
    * Buying actively managed funds with an expense ratio higher than 0.5% is a bad idea, as are funds with a turnover of more than 50%
* Closed-end funds
    * Shares are not issued or redeemed after the initial offering
    * Need to go through broker to sell
    * Sometimes sold at discount, which makes them attractive
    * Malkiel's advice: Discount of >10% is attractive
    * Even if the price never increases, you get more dividends than you really paid for
* Investment advisors
    * Helpful for legal or tax questions
    * Expensive: Could cost 1-3% per year
    * Often have a conflict of interest: They might get paid to sell you certain funds
    * Wealthfront: 0.25-1%
