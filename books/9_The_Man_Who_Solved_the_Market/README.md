# The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution


## Thoughts on Simons

1. Simons was brilliant: He had his bachelor from MIT at 20, PhD from Berkeley at 23, was an accomplished code cracker at the NSA at 26, led an entire math department as a professor at 30, turned that department into a really good one, and made significant contributions to geometry. Even without his RenTec achievements, he had an amazing career
2. Simons dabbled in finance with very little success before going all in: Pretty much between every life stage outlined above, Simons tried his luck with investing, and rarely did he achieve much. RenTec wasn't any sort of instant or overnight success
3. Everything in Simons' life prepared him for RenTec: He learned to solve hard problems in his math education, learned to use algorithms to find patterns in data as a code cracker, and he learned to recruit the academic elite as department chair
4. Simons was really lucky: Without too much of his own doing he had millions at 40. He could quit academia without worrying about money at all and it would've been no problem for him financially had RenTec failed. Similarly, he entered the hedge fund field at pretty much the perfect time: it wasn't computerized yet but there was data to find patterns in

## Other thoughts

- Pretty much every single person in the book sounds both absolutely brilliant and absolutely miserable. I'm genuinely not sure if anyone's life really got improved by their job at RenTec and by making that much more money
- There's a certain beauty about things like hidden markov model's being applicable to so many - seemingly unrelated - things: speech recognition, stock markets, etc
- The thought that successful scientists can switch fields and attack the field's open problems from a completely new angle seems kind of cool
- Machine learning researchers, computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians are the usual suspects for these kinds of model fitting jobs. However, astronomers apparently also fit it really well because they are used to looking through huge amounts of data to find a small signal
- RenTec had (and probably has) some trading strategies that only make money in 50.5% of transactions. If you do a lot of such transactions these are still really profitable. Most hedge funds at the time thought such strategies were not worth trading, leaving room that RenTec filled
- RenTec was brilliant at minimizing transaction costs, which is one of the reasons why it could execute 50.5% strategies
- For years, RenTec only traded with commodities & similar stuff, but not with stocks. While stocks did require more complicated modeling, they also just had bugs in their code which prevented their strategies from working. It seems to me like RenTec could've saved a few years of headaches about stock trading had they paid more attention to proper software engineering earlier on
