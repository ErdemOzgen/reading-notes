## What may I hope?

### 28. Le Bec – Does God exist?

- Anselm of Canterbury's proof for god's existence: By definition, God is the greatest being imaginable that can be surpassed by nothing else. So one of God's properties must be that he exists, because otherwise he would not be the greatest possible thing. So there must be a God
- This is an *ontological proof*
- Thomas Aquinas was one of the critics of this proof. If you replace the word "God" by "isle", you could make the same conclusion. That does not mean that such an isle exists. Furthermore, what we can imagine is different across people, and we can always imagine something greater
- Thomas Aquinas had his own attempt at a  proof: Something needs to have created the world, so there must be a God
- Bertrand Russel's response to this: If everything needs to be started by something, then there has to be an infinite chain of gods being created by previous gods. It is also possible that the world did not need to be created and always existed
- Kant thought that it does not make sense to try to proof that a God exists since it might not be possible for humans to comprehend the existence of something greater than themselves

### 29. Bishop Wearmouth – Does nature have a purpose?

- William Paley: Nature is so perfect that it has to have been created by an intelligent being
- But why is there something bad in the world? E.g. why do some our our body parts sometimes hurt. Shouldn't God have prevented this?
- Paley's response: There is more good than bad. And maybe God's creation isn't yet done
- Darwin picked up on this a few decades later. He introduced the theory of evolution. He also noted that indeed nothing completely bad would ever be created that way. Furthermore, evolution is still going on and can be observed
- So in the core argument, Darwin does not agree with Paley. However, he does pick up on some of his ideas

### 30. Bielefeld – What is love?

- There are many definitions of love
- Notions of love much predate human monogamy
- There could be some evolutionary advantages of having something like love. Biology does not clearly define love though, so it is hard to reason well about its evolutionary advantages
- > "Love is not wanting anything for yourself but wanting everything for the other person"

### 31. Naxos – What is freedom?

- > Socrates: "To be is to do"
- > Sartre: "To do is to be"

### 32. Más a Tierra – Do we need property?

- What is property?
  - If we cannot do anything with it, we do not consider it to be something we own
  - Yet, most societies limit how much we can do with the things we own. E.g. if you own a house or flat, you can't just do with it whatever you like
- All societies so far have had some form of property. Even communist states did not ban all kinds of property. They just banned owning property that can be used to produce something, since that could lead to more inequality
- Humans use property as an abstraction to organize society

### 33. Boston - What is fair?

- John Rawl's theory of justice:
   - Let's assume nobody in society has any idea of their personal skills or disadvantages
   - What kind of social system can people in such a society agree on? For example, how would they distribute wealth and tax income?
   - Whatever they agree on can be called fair. It is exactly what they would find fair without knowledge of their personal gifts
- Of course this is a completely theoretical mind game. Such an initial state of society never existed and will presumably never exist
- Conservatives disliked Rawl's theory because it seemed too socialist to them and because it ignores personal traits
- Socialists disliked Rawl's theory because it still results in an unequal society (even though it is one that people agreed on)

### 34. Vanuato - What is a happy life?

- Vanuato is the happiest place on Earth according to some studies
- Wealthy Western countries generally rank quite badly
- A divorce leads to as much unhappiness as a paycut of 2/3 of the compensation
- Earning more money very quickly does not result in a proportional amount of additional happiness anymore. Still, we optimize for the gross domestic product instead of a happiness index
- A common strategy for more happiness is to reduce expectations. That is a fairly bad idea:
  - We need expectations to get somewhere. Without having expectations and going for them, few things happen to you
  - A better approach would be to get better at dealing with disappointment as it is a natural part of life
- (*Note: This chapter contained a lot of the author's personal thoughts and did not reference other philosophers that much*)

### 35. Athens – Can we learn to be happy?

- Epicurus was a Greek philosopher that was one of the first to write about happiness. He came up with several principles
  - Appreciate the small things in life
  - Do not be dependent on luxury
  - Cherish relationships
- Since then, happiness researchers have built on his work and came up with more rules for leading a happy life:
  1. Stay active: the brain needs new impulses to not deteriorate. Overly following routines can be harmful
  2. Live socially: we all need people we can rely on and talk to when things are difficult
  3. Concentration: live in the moment and enjoy things to their fullest.
     > "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans" - John Lennon
  4. Be realistic: your expectations should not be totally off, else you get disappointed
  5. Positive thoughts: what we think does shape us, so it is important to keep a positive mindset
  6. No comparisons: we are all different and comparisons are rarely fair. Photos in magazines are so photoshopped that they are not something realistic to compare to. Furthermore, we all have different starting points in life, so we should only compare us to ourselves
  7. Have fun at work: we spend a significant amount of time at work and it is important for humans to feel useful and needed
- Questions about happiness are more psychological than philosophical nowadays

### 36. Utopia – Does life have a meaning?

- Plato’s *Allegory of the Cave*: Imagine a group of people that live in a cage and are constrained so that they can only look on a wall. On that wall, they see shadows moving. This is the only reality they have ever known. If one of the captives escaped, saw the actual world, and returned; nobody would believe him
- The movie *Matrix* brought a similar thought experiment into pop culture
- One realization is that *only* happiness would be meaningless. We need the contrast to other things to perceive happiness
- Until a few hundred years ago, philosophers did not really ask about the meaning of life since that question would have been answered by philosophy
- Afterwards, philosophers did start to tackle the question. For example, Bentham tried to answer it with utilitarism
- > "But then, if life has no meaning, what is it that prevents us from inventing one for it?" – Lewis carol
- > "Life may have no meaning. Or even worse, it may have a meaning of which I disapprove" – Ashleigh Brilliant
