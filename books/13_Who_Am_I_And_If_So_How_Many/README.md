# Who Am I?: And If So, How Many? [[amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Am-If-How-Many/dp/0385531184) [[review]](https://florian.github.io/reading-2021/#who-am-i-and-if-so-how-many)

Kant divided the field of philosophy into four questions:

1. [What can I know?](03-11_What_can_I_know.md)
2. [What must I do?](12-27_What_must_I_do.md)
3. [What may I hope?](28-36_What_may_I_hope.md)
4. What is the human being?

This book follows this taxonomy. However, the author believes that the first three questions cover the fourth one very well, so it is omitted here.
