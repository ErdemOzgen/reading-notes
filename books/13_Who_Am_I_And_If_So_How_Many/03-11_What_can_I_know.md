## What can I know?

### 3. Sils Maria – What is truth?

- Nietzsche's "God is dead" was not particularly new at the time. Darwin had come out with his book some years before
- However, Nietzsche spins the philosophical implications further. He is the first to state that humans are yet another animal and do not have a universal mind
- This implies that what we perceive as objective does not have to be something truly objective across animals
- We evaluate everything through a human lens. Questions like "what is moral?" or "what is intelligent?" are not something we view objectively with respect to other animals
- Our senses are limiting us when objectively trying to answer these questions. Without knowing how other animals perceive things, we are not able to make completely general statements

### 4. Hadar – Where do we come from?

- Humans and dolphins are the only two animals where the brain grows faster than the rest of the body even after birth
- Why human brains grew that much evolutionary is still unclear
- When observing other animals it is hard to figure out what to look for to evaluate intelligence. Other animals might use their intelligence for very different things which at first glance could look unimpressive to us because we have other needs and values

### 5. Madrid – How does my brain work?

- How the brain works used to be a philosophical question. Nowadays it has been largely answered by neuroscience and is not much of a philosophical question anymore
- Neuroscientists use the human brain to understand human brains. That approach is not different to how philosophers use the human brain to reason about human brains. The question of how far one can get using this approach has philosophical aspects to it

### 6. Ulm – How do I know who I am?

- Descartes' works
  - We cannot trust our senses (listening, hearing, etc) because they could be influenced by something
  - Similarly we cannot trust our thinking
  - However, if we doubt all our thinking, we cannot doubt that we doubt everything. Therefore, we must be able to trust our doubting, which means we have to trust some of our thinking
  - "Cogito, ergo sum", "I think, therefore I am" was Descartes' first principle
- Reaction on Descartes
  - Descartes fully trusts language even though it could deceive you just as well as your senses can. This has been criticized
  - It became more popular to see humans as machines that are controlled by the brain

### 7. Vienna – Who is "I"?

- Mach did not only come up with the physical constant named after him but also questioned whether there's something like a self
- Hume had tackled this question from a philosophical perspective. He concludes that the self is an illusion
- This is not just a philosophical question but has implications on ethics and law making

### 8. OMICRON CETI II – What are feelings?

- People sometimes say that Spock from Star Treck has no emotions. That's not true as feelings are just brain activity like thoughts. Rationally acting towards something means having values and goals in mind. So there cannot be a thinking animal without feelings
- Describing a set of common feelings is very language-dependent. Translations for feelings often do not transfer the meaning completely between languages
- Emotions are raw and unconscious. Feelings are conscious and influenced by active thinking

### 9. Vienna – What is my subconscious?

- Freud founded the field of psychoanalysis
- Many of his theories were proven wrong in the end. His contribution after all is less in the concrete theories and more in putting emphasis on understanding human psychology by talking to people
- One of the fundamental concepts from Freud are the id, ego and super-ego:
  - id: the component of our personality that is driven by physical and low-level needs
  - super-ego: the component driven by values and goals engraved to us by society
  - ego: acts in ways that satisfy the id, the super-ego and the constraints given by society
- Nietzsche introduced a fairly similar model quite a bit before Freud
- Lots of empirical studies have shown how our environment can influence our subconciousness

### 10. New York – What is the mind?

- How the mind and memory work used to be philosophical questions. Nowadays they have been answered by neuroscience to large degrees
- The philosophical questions nowadays are rather about the implications of these discoveries

### 11. Cambridge – What is language?

- Wittgenstein
  - Philosophy suffers because language is often too imprecise
  - One should view language as logic. Language should only be able to express things that are objectively attestable
  - Language allows modeling the world
- Wittgenstein followed Bertrand Russell's work on logic quite closely
- In the decades afterwards, it became clearer that language as logic is not a apt point of view. Instead, the point of language is communication. When interacting with other people, our goal is not to only state objectively attestable things but to get across a certain message
