## What must I do?

### 12. Paris – Do we need other people?

- Rousseau
  - Humans are good by nature but society makes them bad
  - Empirical evidence according to him: There are a lot of crime and bad things in the world today. Outside of society, people must be good because they would only care about themselves and would not need other people
  - However, nature forces us to collaborate to survive
- Nowadays, it is pretty clear to us that Rousseau's argument is rather weak. Historians can show that in the past there was a lot more violence than nowadays
- Similarly, psychologists would not confirm that most people are happy just existing by themselves without any companions

### 13. Madison – Why do we help others?

- Helping others is an evolutionary advantage. Species that provide help for each other are more robust
- Along the same lines, species having some sort of 'moral' is an evolutionary advantage. Being collaborative is useful for the survival of the species. If this collaboration becomes sufficiently complex, then some form of morals is needed to keep the system running

### 14. Königsberg – Why should I be good?

- Kant's categorical imperative: Only act in some way if you are fine with this being turned into a general law
- Rousseau's "humans are bad by nature" is too simplified for Kant. Instead, he believes that "humans have the choice to do right or wrong"
- Kant defined the human dignity: It is something special to be able to choose how you want to act, and something that's unique in humans
- Kant's contribution to philosophy is not just his categorical imperative but in shining light on the fact that people choose their morals 

### 15. Frankfurt – Can I want what I want?

- Schopenhauer: Do we really want what we want? I.e. is there a thing such as the free will?
- The *Libet experiment*: We can measure the time between brain activity starting an action, the person being aware of the action chosen, and the action executed. Between the first two there is a 0.35s delay. Between the last two there is another 0.2s delay
- The experiment has been criticised by some and there are different interpretations of the result. One of those is that humans do not have a free will (since the decision is made before the person becomes aware) but that they do have something like 'free unwill' (once the person becomes aware they have 0.2s to reject the decision)

### 16. Cavendish – Are there morals in my brain?

- Morals are not just in one part of the brain
- They are continuously defined by social interactions which influence many parts of the brain

### 17. Parma – Is it worth it to be good?

- Scientists found out that people have very similar brain activity when they see someone experience something good compared to experiencing the same thing themselves
- Kant said that we should do good out of duty's sake instead of doing it to feel good, because it'd be more consistent. That might not be true considering how good we feel helping others

### 18. Boston – Is moral inborn to us by birth?

- Thought experiment: A train is moving towards five people trapped on the train route. You can change the trajectory of the train so that it will only kill one. Will you do it?
- A Harvard professor did survey of 300,000 people. A similar percentage of them agreed on the decision irrespective of language, culture, religion or other characteristics
- This let to the question: Are we born with morals?
- Additional thought experiment: What if you actively had to push a human on the track to save the five people
- Now many fewer people agree. The exception are sociopaths, which do not distinguish at all between these scenarios
- Our laws reflect that the act of actively doing something is handled differently than more passive ways
- It's hard to say whether we are born with some sense of morals, or whether different cultures evolved to have a similar basic sets of morals because they are just evolutionary helpul

###  19 to 27 – Using philosophy to discuss ethical questions

- (*Note: These chapters discuss various ethical questions based on the philosophical principles explained earlier. They are complex topics and I do not think that I can do them justice in a few bullet points. So I chose to instead summarize the philosophical ideas mentioned*)
- Bentham's *utilitarianism*: You should live in a way that maximizes the good in the world and minimizes the bad
- At first that sounds sensible. However, does that justify killing people. E.g. if someone purely does negative things to the world
- Blindly following utilitarianism would destroy any order of society in the long term
- *Preference utilitarianism*: utilitarianism, but weighted by how self-aware of intelligent a being is. Most humans agree with weighting in some form, but it very quickly gets tricky and dangerous to spell out rules
- Humans often try to measure the intelligence of other species by looking at things that humans are good at
