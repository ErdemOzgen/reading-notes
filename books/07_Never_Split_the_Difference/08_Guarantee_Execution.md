## 8. Guarantee Execution

* Calibrated “how” questions keep the negotiation going
    * They force empathy on the other party
    * The other party gets an illusion of power and has to think about solutions
* > Negotiation is the art of letting someone else have your way
* Language is important and can subconsciously influence us: “Not lose” vs “keep"
* *7-38-55 rule*: 7% of a message is based on words, 38% on the tone of the voice and 55% on body language
* Liars use more words, use more third-party pronouns (to put distance between the lie and themselves) and talk in more complex ways
* The less someone talks about themselves, the more important they are
* Using someone’s name humanizes them (e.g. a hostage, or yourself when someone is angry at you)
