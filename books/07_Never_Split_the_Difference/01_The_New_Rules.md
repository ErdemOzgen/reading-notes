## 1. The New Rules

* An early approach of systematically negotiating was based on four principles
    1. Separate person/emotion from the problem
    2. Instead of focusing on *what* someone is asking for, think about the *why* to understand what they really want
    3. Cooperatively look for win-win solutions
    4. Mutually establish how such potential solutions are evaluated
* Cognitive biases
    * *Framing Effect*: People respond differently depending on how something is framed. For example, people assign greater value to going from 90% to 100% than from 45% to 55%, even though both are the same absolute 10% increase
    * *Loss Aversion*: People are more likely to wanting to avoid losses than to wanting to achieve an equivalent gain
    * *Prospect Theory*: Builds on loss aversion and describes how people are more willing to take risks to avoid losses than to gain something equivalent. (*Note: It was not entirely clear to me what the exact difference to loss aversion is, but it seems like prospect theory also models how one's sensitivity to risk changes with potential gains/losses*)
* *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
    * *System 1*: Fast, instinctive, emotional
    * *System 2*: Slow, deliberate, logical
    * The system 1 response influences system 2 behavior, e.g. our initial emotional response influences the more explicit beliefs of system 2
* Most of the early negotiating theory was very focused on system 2 (rational / systematic approaches) but not much on system 1 (emotional / fast-paced responses), even though system 1 responses are more common in many negotiating situations, e.g. hostage situations
* Making sure the other person feels listened to is important as it will make them less defensive and more open to alternative viewpoints (*tactical empathy*)
* Negotiating serves two purposes
    1. information gathering
    2. behavior influencing
