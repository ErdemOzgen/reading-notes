## Appendix

* Some preparation for negotiations can make sense, though a lot of things need to be improvised and you cannot create perfect scripts
* Trade-off: A 1-pager with several sections
    1. Goal: What do you want to achieve? Think about the worst and best possible outcomes. Be ambitious about what you are aiming for
    2. Summary: Summarize everything that led up to the negotiation in a way that the other party would approve with “That’s right"
    3. Labeling / accusation audit: Write down five things the other party might hold against you and prepare labels for them
    4. Calibrated questions: 3-5 that can move the negotiation. Focus on what the other party actually *wants*, not what they *demand*
    5. Non-cash offers: Think of anything the other party could offer that would lead to you accepting (much) less money
* *BATNA*: *Best alternative to negotiated agreement*. This should not influence your goal though because it might lead to you anchoring on something that is not ambitious enough
