## 9. Bargain Hard

* Three bargaining types
    * *Analysist*: Systematic, methodological, diligent, do not like surprises, separates negotiation and relationship
    * *Accommendator*: Friendly, sociable, wants to have a good relationship with the counterparty
    * *Assertive*: Very focused on their own goal, wants to be time-efficient, only gets to your concerns when they feel heard
* *Black Swan rule*: Don't treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat them the way they want to be treated
* *Zone of Possible Agreements* (*ZOPA*): Set of deals that both parties would accept. But modeling this often means having to assume that parties are more rational than they really tend to be

* Bargaining for a price: By default people often meet in the middle
* *Ackerman model*:
    1. Set your target price and offer 65% of that
    2. Go up to 85%, 95%, 100% while nicely rejecting their offer
    3. When giving the final number use a precise, non-round number. You can also throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably do not want), just to show that you cannot give more
* > We just like $1.99 more than $2.00 even if we know it’s a trick
* If someone does not reject your offer but wants more time, that usually means you have the edge
