## 15. Exit Stage Left (The Good King)

* Two ways for startups to *exit* (meaning for VCs to make a return on their investment): IPO or acquisition
* Acquisitions
    * More common than IPOs nowadays. Historically they happened roughly the same number of times
    * 80% of exits are now acquisitions
    * Many acquisitions begin as business partnerships
    * Forming relationships to potential acquirers is important. One should not expose company-internal information (since the companies might be competing) but knowing each other can pay off
    * Most companies are bought not sold: It is difficult to find buyers yourself when you want to sell. Rather, you should make sure that when companies do want to buy in a certain space, you are on top of their list
    * Price is the most important feature of an acquisition. If the company is not acquired in cash but in shares, an analysis for how well they are priced needs to be done. Commonly, clauses are added that protect against major stock price movements until the acquisition is done
    * The acquirer usually wants to keep key employees. Depending on how their stock vests, their existing stock plan might be directly converted to the new company's stock, or they receive a completely new plan
    * The acquirer puts 10-15% of the acquisition price into an escrow account that will be used for legal fees, should any arise
    * There's many other legal things that need to be agreed on when negotiating an acquisition
    * It's the board's job to maximize the short-term payoff of common shareholders when agreeing to an acquisition (vs long-term in all other situations)
* IPO
    * There used to be many advantages of IPOs
        * Publicity
        * Branding as successful company
        * Liquidity for people who want to sell their stock
        * Customer credibility
        * Making it easier to acquire other companies with equity, since it is simple to value that equity
    * Only some of these are still true today. For example, it is now easier to raise large sums of money privately and Silicon Valley startups generally enjoy a lot of publicity
    * First step of the IPO process is to hire the *underwriters*, investment banks (IBs) in charge of preparing the IPO
    * IBs are e.g. chosen based on their expertise in the company's sector
    * Usually there is a main underwriter and several co-underwriters
    * *Prospectus*: Huge legal document telling the company's narrative and containing many legal disclosures
    * The 2012 *JOBS* Act made it easier for startups to file the prospectus
        * *Emerging growth companies* (*EGC*s) qualify: Companies with less than $1b revenue in the last fiscal year
        * Advantages include: Being able to talk to prospective buyers (institutional investors), filling secretly with the SEC, lighter regulations
    * Once the SEC is happy, the next step begins: The *road show*
        * IBs travel across the US and Europe to talk to potential buyers
        * This helps figure out how to price the stock ("building the book")
        * (*Note: Interesting, the same term was used when raising money for new hedge funds*)
    * Pricing an IPO is challenging
        * You want a slow but steady upward trajectory for the stock price over time
        * However, the company does not benefit from the stock appreciating. It only gets the initial price for it, so selling for too little is painful
        * Selling too high ("breaking issue price") can be even worse because the stock price will fall quickly, which will not be good for the public perception of the stock/company
        * FB's stock opened at $38 and dropped to $14 in one day
    * *Green shoe* mechanism (named after the first company that used it)
        * Underwriter sells 15% more stocks than originally planned
        * For these stocks they retain the option to buy them back the IPO price
        * If the price surges, they exercise the option and sell on the market for the higher price
        * If the price falls, they buy the 15% from the market and deliver those to the original buyers
        * In both cases the IB makes a profit and helps stabilize the price
        * (*Note: I don't fully understand the incentives between company and IBs. It seems if the IBs mess up the IPO price, they can still make a good profit using these green shoe options*)
    * Liquidity for previous stock holders
        * They need to wait for 6 months before being able to sell shares publicly. This ensures that the price stays stable
        * VCs might sit on board of directors and could thus be bound to only trade during certain months. This means they might also not sell directly after the 6 months are over
        * One reasons why VCs want to exit public companies is that LPs already have part of their portfolio exposed to public companies. They hired the VC to invest in private companies
