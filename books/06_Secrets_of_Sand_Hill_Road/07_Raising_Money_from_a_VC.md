## 7. Raising Money from a VC

* John Doerr compared raising capital to cocktail parties: When the waiter comes, you always take something, because you never know when he will come again
* There are VC funds that focus on funding companies where the exit plan is an acquisition
* Rule of thumb: Raise enough money so that you can achieve milestones necessary for the next funding round (which are very specific to companies and markets)
* Many startups raise new cash every 12-24 months
* To get Series B funding: A good set of features need to exist and the company needs to have some paying customers ($3-5M revenue)
* Many software companies have $100M (or a few multiples of that) in funding before going for an IPO
* It makes sense to raise money often, or at least multiple times. Raising everything at once is much more expensive (since the company has a lower valuation initially), difficult, and introduces psychological challenges (e.g. taking on too many projects because you have enough cash to burn)
* A high valuation makes it cheaper to raise money but it can also be dangerous
    * Much higher expectations for future fund raising
    * Coupled with actually not raising much money in that round it can be especially dangerous: You will need to raise money soon again but might not have much more to show for
    * If enough VCs think the valuation is too high, there will be little competition for this founding round, which is bad for the company
* Raising money from VCs means that everyone's shares get deluded. Giving 10% equity to a VC means, everyone else's equity is now worth 10% less
