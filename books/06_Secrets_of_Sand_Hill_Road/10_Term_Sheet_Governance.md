## 10. The Alphabet Soup of Term Sheets: Part Two (Governance)

* The governance section determines who gets to decide on what in the company
* Board of Directors
    * The board hires/fires the CEO and has to vote on major things like raising money or selling the company
    * Odd-sized boards are common (but not legally required)
    * Major investors typically get to assign a seat in the board
    * One seat is generally reserved for the current CEO
    * It is popular to only let founders get seats for as long as they work at the company
    * How seats are otherwise assigned is a matter of negotiation
* Protective provisions
    * There are many ways to structure how votes are organized
    * Which one to choose is a matter of negotiation and aligning incentives correctly
    * Common things preferred stock holders vote on
        * Authorization of new classes of stock
        * Acquisition and sale of IP
        * Liquidation (shutdown of the company) or recapitalization
        * Increase of employee option plan
    * Generally these are designed to protect the economic interest of preferred stock holders
* Registration rights
    * When the company goes public, shares need to be registered
* Pro Rata Investments
    * If the company raises capital by issuing more equity, VCs already invested generally want to be able to invest again to make sure to not get their share diluted
    * This section ensures that these VCs are able to do that
    * For convenience, there’s a minimum amount of equity a shareholder needs to be able to do this
    * Critical scaling limiter for VC funds is the number of board seats a GP can handle
    * Most GPs do not take more than 10-12 seats
    * This is why VCs want to own a significant amount of shares for each board seat they occupy
    * Another cardinal sin of VC: Invest in a hugely successful company but only own a small share
* Stock restriction
    * *Right-of-first-refusal* (*ROFR*): If you want to sell stock to someone, you first have to ask the company if they match the offer. If they do, the get the first right to buy the shares
    * ROFR makes it difficult to sell stuff. People do not want to negotiate stock price if there is a good chance they will not be able to buy it (because the company makes use of their ROFR)
    * *Co-sale agreement*: If you want to sell stock to someone, every other investor gets the right to sell the same portion of their shares to that person. Since the person likely does not want to buy that much, they end up buying a smaller portion but do so from every willing investor
    * Both of these are designed to make it difficult for founders to sell equity
    * VCs want founders to be really invested in the company
* Drag along
    * Designed so that smaller investors cannot block an acquisition
    * Holders of >=2% of shares have to agree to sell their share in an acquisition, if this acquisition is approved by (1) the board, (2) the preferred class stock holders, (3) the common stock holders
    * In an acquisition, roughly 90% of the stock is generally sold
    * We do not care about investors with <2% since they will not be able to influence the acquisition outcome anyways
* D&O insurance
    * Company purchases legal insurance
    * VCs already have this, but having it in both places does not hurt
* Vesting
    * Founder and employee vesting are described
    * 2017 tax reform: Employees can defer tax on stock options for up to five years
* Employee and consultant agreements
    * Employees and consultants sign NDAs
    * They give up all IP while working at the company
* No-Shop
    * Term sheet is non-binding
    * It can take 2-4 weeks for lawyers to convert it to legal documents
    * During this time, neither VC nor company can shop for better deals, or show this one to anyone
* (*Note: There’s probably something educational in the fact that this and the previous chapters were probably the ones least fun to read, and in how difficult the term sheet in the appendix is to read*)
