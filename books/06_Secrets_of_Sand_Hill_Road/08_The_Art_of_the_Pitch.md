## 8. The Art of the Pitch

* (Beginning of the chapter talks shortly about the sacrifices founders make to start the company, e.g. giving up on vacation, working long hours, living cheaply for many years)
* Seed and angel investors commonly refer their startups to VCs, as do law firms
* Otherwise, how creatively you go about getting a meeting with a VC is part of the screening process
* Several import aspects of the pitch
* Market size is incredibly important
    * You have to convince the VC that your startup has the potential for huge returns, since that is the thing VCs ultimately look for
    * Sometimes you can argue that you could capture a portion of an existing market. It can be much better to argue for creating a bigger market though
    * Example: If cancer pre-screening would become easier and more accurate, there would be a much bigger market than nowadays
* Pitching the team is the next most important thing
    * Highlight why your team specifically should get funded for this and why you are a good fit for this kind of company
    * Talking about failures is not discouraged
    * Story telling skills are important
* Product
    * Highlight how you arrived at the business idea. VCs want to see how your brain works
    * > What data have you incorporated from the market; how is it more aspirin than vitamin; how is this product ten times better or cheaper than alternatives?
* Go-to-market strategy
    * Talk about strategy for going to market on a high level
    * Even if it will not be feasible in this founding round, it is still important to talk about
    * No robust financial models needed, but a framework around how customers will be acquired
    * Pivoting is accepted and not uncommon
* Goals for this round of funding
    * Clearly articulate the milestones you want to reach with the money raised in this round
    * If the milestones are not enough or are too risky to achieve, consider raising more capital this round
    * VCs diversify within their funds
    * It is important for VCs that eventually others start investing as well. You have to convince them that you won't get stranded at the next funding round, with that VC being your only investor again
* If you forget all of this, just remember that the most important thing is to convince the VC that outsize returns are possible
* (*Note: This chapter reminds me of Paul Grahamâ€™s post about [AirBnB](http://www.paulgraham.com/airbnb.html)*)
