## 6. Forming Your Startup

* Most startups will want to create C companies since this is more optimal from a tax perspective when it comes to building up equity
* While other forms of entities might make more sense in the very beginning, converting the company to a different legal entity is too much of a hassle for this to be worth it
* Founders should also vest their equity, to avoid one founder leaving early having as much equity as all other founders
* (*Note: "[Vesting is a hack](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/)" is an interesting read*)
* Board seats should be strategically chosen. It might make sense to add a clause that founders need to keep working at the company while having a board seat (avoid "ruling from the grave")
* It generally makes sense to add restrictions for when founders / employees are allowed to sell equity
    * Imagine the company is trying to raise new money, while a co-founder, who has already left the company, is trying to sell their equity. Now you are essentially competing with them for buyers
    * Possible solution: Selling stock has to be approved by the board
    * Alternative: Company has right-of-first-refusal, meaning if it matches offers, it has to be able to buy the equity. For startups without much cash, this is not that useful however
* Letting a founder automatically vest all their remaining equity when they leave the startup can be a bad choice. It is probably better for the company if the unvested equity is returned to the company, who can then use it to create incentives for other employees
* When acquiring startups, companies generally prefer double-triggers
    * Single-trigger means that the founders get all their equity when the startup is acquired
    * To make sure the founders go on to work at the acquiring company, it needs to create new incentives by offering additional equity
    * A double-trigger means that the founders only vest all remaining equity if the acquiring company does not want the founders to work at the new company
    * This is fair for the founders, and the acquiring company does not have to give out additional equity if it wants to keep the founders
* Founders should give up rights for all inventions to the company
    * Important that they worked on them at the new company, not at their previous employer
    * Lawsuits can happen many years into the future, often when an acquisition is about to take place
* Employee equity pool
    * To incentivize employees
    * Usually 15% of the company’s equity, but can differ. The founders give up this equity once they decide to hire
    * Employees get stock options, i.e. the right to buy stock at a certain price when they choose to exercise it
    * If the stock appreciates and you can sell it, you exercise, otherwise you do not
    * Two types of stock options in the US
        * *Incentive stock Options* (*ISOs*): Tax is paid on the exercise price, not the fair market value. This can be vastly more tax-efficient. The employee can then hold the stock for 1yr after exercising the option to get the lower capital gain tax when selling
        * *Non-qualified options* (*NQOs*): Tax is computed on fair market value, regardless of how long the stock is held afterwards
        * There are restrictions on ISOs though: Companies can only issue $100k worth of ISOs per employee per year
        * ISOs have to be exercised by employee within 90 days when leaving the company, otherwise they are voided. This can be difficult for these employees, because they might need to come up with a lot of cash to exercise everything
        * (*Note: “[90 Days and My Six-Figure Mistake](https://medium.com/@ben_mathes/90-days-and-my-six-figure-mistake-a495f4a188e2)” is an interesting read*)
        * Companies have started to offer longer time periods by automatically converting the ISOs to NQOs, which can then be kept for several years before exercising
        * (*Note: Quora was one of the first companies to do this and their CEO’s [explanation](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-startups-force-employees-to-exercise-their-vested-ISO-options-within-90-days-if-they-leave-rather-than-the-option-to-convert-to-NSOs) of it is interesting to read as well*)
    * Employees should vest just like founders. A cliff (e.g. start vesting after 1yr) is common
* 20 years ago, there were around 300 IPOs per year, now it is just 150. Small-cap companies IPO much less nowadays
    * Reason unclear, but there are many guesses
      * IPOs are more expensive now because of additional regulations
      * Mutual funds are now much bigger and often only invest in larger companies
      * Alternatives for private investing exist (but it seems like they mostly just entered the market after companies started IPO’ing later)
      * Staying private means one does not have to deal as much with activist investors that want to change the course of the company or introduce new board members
    * Founders have to expect to stay private for >10yrs. This makes it especially important to incentivize employees to stay for a longer time. Stock refreshers are important
