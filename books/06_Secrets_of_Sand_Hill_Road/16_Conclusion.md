## Conclusion: The World Is Flat

* a16z thinks support in building a company is a bigger differentiator than capital
* Funding company has become cheaper thanks to cloud computing
* Winning as a company has become more difficult
    * “The world is flatter”: In the earlier days the US accounted for roughly 90% of VC funding, now it is more like 50%
    * Startups thus face competition from all over the world
    * But this also means the potential markets are bigger
* Microsoft’s market cap has increased 2,200x (not %) since it went public. This is because companies went public much earlier during that time
* Companies staying private longer is, in a sense, bad for the public. They cannot participate in the returns of small VC-backed companies anymore
* Future of VC
    * > Marc likes to keep us ahead of the curve by often asking whether we are in fact simply the most advanced dinosaur
    * Crowdfunding is an alternative, but still much smaller ($1b vs $80b VC in 2017)
    * *Initial coin offerings* (*ICO*s) are another alternative. In 2017, they raised roughly $4b, 5% of the VC market
    * (*Note: The numbers for ICOs seem extremely high*)
* Good VCs
    * give advice but do not get too involved
    * balance interests of LPs and common shareholders
