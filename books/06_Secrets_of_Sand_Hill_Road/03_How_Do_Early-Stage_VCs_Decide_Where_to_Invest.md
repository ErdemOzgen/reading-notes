## 3. How Do Early-Stage VCs Decide Where to Invest?

* Early on, quantitative metrics are hard to get, so qualitative ones are more important
* Heuristics that VCs use fall into three categories: People, product, market
* People
    * Many startups significantly pivot from their original idea. Thus, evaluating the team of founders can be more important than evaluating the initial idea
    * A given VC will generally not invest into two competing startups. Instead, they pick their horse in the race and stick with it
    * Evaluating the founding team is thus also important to answer the question whether this group of people should be funded or a different one operating in the same space
    * Cardinal sin of VC investing: Get the startup category right but fund the wrong company in that space
    * *Product-first company*: Company was founded to solve a problem the founders encountered
    * *Company-first company*: Founders want to start a company and then brainstorm for a product
    * Both can be a successful, but product-first is often more organic and attractive to VCs
    * *Founder-market fit*: Does this team of founders have the characteristics to succeed in the market? (E.g. because of a certain educational background)
    * Can the founders create a compelling story around the company in order to attract great employees and more investment?
* Product
    * Will this actually solve a real problem consumers have (even if they do not yet know it)? Will people be willing to pay for it?
    * More important than the initial idea is how the founders arrived at the idea. This shows their understanding of the area, how strategically they thought about it, and what unique insights they had
    * VCs like founders with strong opinions that are weakly held: Be convinced of your idea, but be willing to pivot if necessary
    * Products should be aspirins not vitamins: Something with a massive advantage over existing solutions
* Market size
    * VCs look for huge successes in the power law distribution. These can only happen if the market is really big
    * Second cardinal sins of VC: Get the company right, but market turns out to be too small
    * Quote paraphrased: Medicore teams can succeed in great markets, but great teams always fail in bad markets
    * Market size can be really difficult to estimate since the market might not yet exist (e.g. AirBnB when it was founded). A VC's ability to understand market size is incredibly important for their career
