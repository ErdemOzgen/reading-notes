## 12. Board Members and the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval

* In many public companies, common shareholders vote for who sits on the board
* In some sense public companies are simpler than private companies here. If all board members are elected by common shareholders, they all have the same goal: maximize the company's value
* In private companies this is more complex. While VC board members do want to maximize the company's value as well, they also have obligations towards their fund and these interests might diverge (e.g. when it comes to acquisitions)
* Functions of the board
    1. Hire/fire the CEO
    2. Review long-term strategy
    3. Approve major operational actions like acquisitions
    4. Maintaining legal compliance
    5. VC-specific: Mentor CEO and help networking
* Getting involved in anything other than the bigger picture is not the job of the board
* CEOs should keep the board informed at the right level and should regularly get feedback from the board
