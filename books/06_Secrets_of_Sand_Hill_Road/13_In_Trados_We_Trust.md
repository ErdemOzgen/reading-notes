## 13. In Trados We Trust

* Duties of board members
    * *Duty of care*: Be reasonably well informed
    * *Duty of loyalty*: Act in the best interest of shareholders instead of enriching yourself using the company
    * *Duty of Confidentiality*: Especially important when companies pivot. If a VC is then invested in two companies in the same market, a Chinese wall has to be created between the GPs managing the relations to the respective companies
    * *Duty of Candor*: Disclose relevant information to shareholders
* Fiduciary duties are only owed to holders of common stock
* *Business Judgement Rule* (*BJR*)
    * Courts do not second-guess board decisions as long as they were made in good faith
    * The process is evaluated rather than the end result
    * This is why boards keep records of what they discussed in each meeting
    * Burden of proof is on the plaintiff
* Burden of proof in duty of loyalty lawsuit is on the board
* A board member is *independent* when they have no special interest in regards to potential acquisitions, etc
* The board is independent if more than half of all board members are independent
* If the board is dependent, it needs to show that common shareholders got a good deal in an acquisition. If the process was not fair, the price needs to be fair
* Hiring a banker to deal with fair process and fair price can be an easy way out. It is costly but protects the board
* If there is a bonus program to get the acquisition done, common and preferred should contribute to it in the same portions relative to what they get out of the deal
* It is a good idea to invite lawyers to a board meeting at least once in order to walk the board through their duties
