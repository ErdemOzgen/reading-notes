## Part 4: Pizza Recipes

### Chapter 9: Pizza and Focaccia Method

- Professional pizza is baked at 400C for 2.5 minutes. You rotate it after half of the time because the oven is 56C hotter in the back where the fire is
- Even the morning after baking, the oven is still 260C hot
- Traditionally, pizza doughs have a hydration of around 65%. The recipes in this book have more around 70-75%
- If you make focaccia, you can use a wetter dough since you do not need to form it as much when baking it in a pan. 80% is fine
- It is fine to fold raw flour into pizza dough if you need to
- Overproofing focaccia is fine since you do not need the dough to expand that much. The overproofing also adds certain flavors
- Use San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce. They have a high amount of pulp, are not watery and not too acidic. For other tomatoes, people usually add a lot of sugar to balance out the acidity
- Drain tomatoes from the tin before using them. You can use the extracted juices for Spanish rice
- You do not need to cook the tomato sauce as it will cook on the pizza while baking. Just puree it with salt, garlic , some chilli flakes and oregano. You can also do a minimal version with just salt
- Forming the dough when it's taken out of the refrigerator is a bit easier
- Pizza stone needs to be pre-heated for 30mins
- Pizza tossing makes the dough thinner and more evenly distributed. It is not strictly necessary though
- If you do not have a pizza stone, you can also use an iron skillet
- There's no clear definition of what pizza vs focaccia is. Some people think it's toppings, depth or oven vs pan; but for any of these there's counter examples and people that disagree. The author just differentiates based on whether cheese is used. If so, it's pizza
