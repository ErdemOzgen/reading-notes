## Part 3: Levain Bread Recipes

### Chapter 7: Understanding Levain

- Yeast occurs naturally all around us, e.g. in the air, on the skin of fruits, on the surface of grains
- Sourdough uses this yeast. It was the only way yeast was used until commercial yeast was introduced in modern times
- Commercial yeast is one single, specific strain of yeast
- Levain means "to rise"
- The author dislikes the term "sourdough" because it does not have to be sour
- When you start a new levain culture it initially looks like dough or batter but starts to get gassy after a few days
- Some people say that you can only make bread that tastes like San Francisco while being in San Francisco (because of the yeast in the environment). That's more a myth than a fact though. Flavor depends more on how you prepare the levain than where it's from. Most of the yeast in the environment is the same across the world
- How the levain was started is also much less important than how it is maintained
- Adding fruits to levains helps short-term aromatics but does not have a lasting effect on the culture as the yeast on the fruit does not live well in a flour environment
- Only add fruit if you use the levain immediately after
- Levain recipes in this book use 80% hydration. The common range of levain hydration is between 60% and 100%
- At the author's bakery, levain hydration is usually the same as the hydration of the final dough. That makes it easier to correctly integrate
- The author adds commercial yeast to all his levain recipes. It's not as pure but the mix has advantages in terms of crust and volume achieved
- The book's levain feeding schedule is once per day in the morning. In the author's bakery they do it three times a day since it's warmer
- (*Note: That sounds like an awful lot of work. What if I'm not home for a few days?*)
- The kind of flour used and the temperature strongly influence what kind of yeast grows, which of course impacts the taste
- Salt is usually not used in levains because it prohibits fermentation
- Only add commercial yeast to the final bread dough. Do not add it to the levain and do not use it as a start for the levain either

### Chapter 8: Levain Method

- The author still uses the same levain he started in 1999 in a bakery class
- Starting a leavain with whole-grain (e.g. wheat or rye) is preferable because it has more yeast and mineral content than white flour
- The ingredients for starting the levain do not have to be exact. They only need to be for feeding if you want consistent results
- In Winter, the author uses more of his levain for the dough because the levain is weaker
- Levain is quite acidic. If you mix it often and have sensitive skin, use gloves
