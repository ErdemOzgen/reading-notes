# Flour Water Salt Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza [[amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X)

This book is split into four parts:

1. The Principles of Artisan Bread
2. Basic Bread Recipes
3. Levain Bread Recipes
4. Pizza Recipes

Each of these parts first has a few chapters about the technique and then chapters with pure recipes.
In these reading notes I only summarize the former kind of chapters.
