# Flour Water Salt Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza [[amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X)

This book is split into four parts:

1. [The Principles of Artisan Bread](02-03_Principles.md)
2. [Basic Bread Recipes](04_Basic_Bread.md)
3. [Levain Bread Recipes](07-08_Levain.md)
4. [Pizza Recipes](09_Pizza_Focaccia.md)

Each of these parts first has a few chapters about the technique and then chapters with pure recipes.
In these reading notes I only summarize the former kind of chapters.
