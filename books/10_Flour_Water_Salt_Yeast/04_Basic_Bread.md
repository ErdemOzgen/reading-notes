## Part 2: Basic Bread Recipes

### Chapter 4: Basic Bread Method

- Do not add salt during autolyse because it prevents the flour from absorbing the water
- Easy way of getting the water temperature right: Use two containers. Alternate between putting hot and cold water into the first container until the target temperature is reached. Then fill into the second until you have the amount you need
- You need to adjust your water temperature depending on your time of autolyse. The temperature of the final mix (i.e. after the autolyse) is the relevant one
- If more than half of your flour is part of the pre-ferment then you do not need an autolyse
- The temperature matters a bit less for pre-ferment since you will not manage to keep it at 26C for the entire night
- On whether to dissolve the instant yeast first: It depends. For wet doughs there's no need. If you use a stand mixer, it's also much better at properly integrating it into the dough than you are. For stiff doughs it can still make sense to dissolve the instant yeast first
- Do not fold dough during bulk fermentation
- (*Note: I feel like later chapters do not follow that advice*)
- Keep a log of different fermentation times, folds, temperatures, and results. Adapt your method based on it
- Fold the final pieces of bread before proofing
- Proofing too little: Loss of flavor development and too little volume
- Proofing too long: Bread collapses
- More tightly shaped bread holds gasses for longer and can be proofed for longer
- The author does not use a razor to make the bread crack open at certain spots. Instead, he turns the loaves upside down after proofing and let's the steam do the work of naturally opening the bread at good spots
- If you really want to, you can use the same dough for pizza and focaccia
- Bread keeps the best in plastic bags. Even if you have an aversion against plastic bags, they might make sense here
