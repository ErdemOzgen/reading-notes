# Factfulness [[amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814)

*Factfulness* is a book that aims to teach about the actual state of the world.
Over the course of the book, 10 human instincts are discussed to explain why people are often not quite aware of which things in the world are actually improving.
The summary here is an overview of these 10 instincts.

## 1. The Gap Instinct

- Whenever people talk about gaps, that implies completely distinct groups, which is rarely the case
- Be careful to compare averages or extreme percentiles instead of looking at the full distribution 
- When looking from “up here” everything “down there” looks equally short because distances are distorted. In reality there might be many more than two groups

## 2. The Negativity Instinct

- We are way more exposed to bad news than good news. This is because a good state or a gradual and slow improvement is not “new”
- Distinguish between the state (“bad”) and the direction of movement (“better”)
- People often glorify the past

## 3. The Straight Line Instinct

- People generally extrapolate linearly even though that often does not work

## 4. The Fear Instinct

- We systematically overestimate some risks
- That is especially the case for things that are more obviously frightening (e.g. terrorism vs a traffic accident)

## 5. The Size Instinct

- Absolute numbers alone can look more impressive than they really are
- Figure out what to set them in context to (e.g. what to divide them by to get a per capita number)

## 6. The Generalization Instinct 

- We like to generalize based on categories 
- Question these generalizations by looking at differences within groups and at similarities across groups

## 7. The Destiny Instinct

- When change is slow, we might feel like everything is constant and blame it on cultural aspects
- Instead, it is important to keep track of gradual improvements and regularly update your knowledge 

## 8. The Single Perspective Instinct

- A common fallacy is to only consider the own perspective 
- Try to be aware of other perspectives 
- Find people that challenge your ideas

## 9. The Blame Instinct

- People like to blame individuals for bad things that happen. They also like to praise individuals for the good things
- This is often oversimplified. The large things in life are not achieved by individuals but by groups of people
- Instead of looking for heroes and villains, understand systems and causes. Try to understand the larger picture 

## 10. The Urgency Instinct

- When things seem urgent, humans drop careful analyses in order to act fast
- However, few decisions actually need to be made so fast that they benefit from not carefully looking at data
- Understand issues well and make sure they are measurable before acting without much thought
