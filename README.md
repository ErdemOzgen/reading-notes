# Reading Notes

## Books

Summarizing books in Markdown doesn't always work well.
So sometimes, I'll link to Jupyter notebooks instead.

### OpenIntro Statistics ([book](https://www.openintro.org/stat/) | [notes](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/blob/master/books/1_OpenIntro-Statistics.md))

OpenIntro Statistics is a freely available textbook that's meant to introduce readers to statistics.
The book does not make many assumptions about the knowledge of readers and is generally on a fairly basic level.
It's a good first introduction to significance tests and statistical modelling.

### Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction ([book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html) | [interactive notes](https://github.com/florian/reinforcement-learning))

Reinforcement Learning is a subarea of Machine Learning where there's no supervisor that tells us the optimal answer / behaviour. Instead, the feedback is delayed and we only get to know a numerical rating of our actions. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* is the canonical book on Reinforcement Learning and gives a good overview over the field. The notes consist of Jupyter notebooks that explain and show implementations for most algorithms from the first two parts of the book.
